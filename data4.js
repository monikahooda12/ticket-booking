He specialises in arthroscopic surgery for ACL/PCL tears, Meniscus tears, shoulder and other minor joint arthroscopy in addition to knee replacement surgery. He has conducted over 4000 joint replacement surgeries, including revision joint replacements. Dr. Debashish has performed over 2000 computer-assisted replacements.

    treatment_brief:
      '<p><span style="font-size:11pt">This is also known as knee arthroplasty, Knee replacement can treat severe pain and help knee joints to function normally. It is a complex procedure requiring the efforts of an orthopedic surgeon. People who usually have pain walking, getting in and out of chairs, climbing and have knee pain even while resting, generally are the ones who need knee replacement. The doctor decides between different prostheses and surgical techniques according to your age, health, weight, activity level and knee size and shape.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">Before the procedure you are given general or spinal anaesthesia. It depends upon the doctor which type of anaesthesia you are given. You will also be given intravenous medications before, between and after the surgery to prevent Post-surgical infection. You could also be given a nerve block to numb the pain around the region. The numbness would wear off after the procedure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">To expose all surfaces of the joint, your knee will be kept in a bent position. The surgeon will cut away the damaged surfaces of the joint by making an incision 6 to 10 inches in length. When the knee is open, the kneecap (patella) is exposed, which is then rotated outside the knee area to help the surgeon view the area which is required for surgery. The surgeon then prepares the joint surfaces by cutting away the damaged bone and cartilage from the end of the femur using surgical instruments. A femoral metal component is then attached to the end of the femur and is sealed into place using bone cement. Next comes the shinbone or the tibia, from the top of which damaged bone and cartilage are removed and the metal and plastic tibial components are fit. The tibial tray (the bottom of the implant) is fitted to the tibia and secured using bone cement. Polyethene (medical-grade plastic) is inserted between the tibial tray and the femoral component, which acts as a buffer to provide support for bending and knee flexing. In the end, the patella is flattened and made fit with an additional plastic component to ensure proper fitting. The surgeon then tests the knee by rotating and bending it and ensures proper alignment, sizing, positioning and functioning of the knee. The surgery lasts for about two hours. You will be taken to a recovery room after the procedure and will be allowed to go home after an hour or two depending on your condition.</span></p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p><span style="font-size:11pt">For people with severe hip damage caused by osteoarthritis and due to symptoms like hip pain which limits daily activities like walking or bending, stiffness in the hip, inadequate pain relief from anti-inflammatory drugs, and when other treatments like physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise do not help, hip replacement surgery is opted by surgeons. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">For evaluation, your orthopedic surgeon may ask for a complication physical examination. Tests like blood and urine tests, an electrocardiogram, and chest x-rays might be needed for planning the treatment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Upon your arrival, you will be given anesthesia (the type depending upon your body)to block sensation from the waist down. An incision is made, generally at the side or back of the hip in order to expose the bones at the hip joint. The joint is then dislocated by the surgeon and the head of the femur is removed from its socket (acetabulum). In a total hip arthroplasty (total hip replacement), the damaged bone and cartilage are replaced with prosthetic components. The Thearthritic femoral head is cut off with a bone saw. The acetabulum is prepared for the acetabular cup prosthesis using a special tool called a hemispheric reamer to grind down and shape the socket. Then, the acetabular cup which is made up of porous titanium metal to allow the bone to grow into it over time, is inserted into the prepared socket. The cup can also be secured with special bone cement. The patient&rsquo;s physiology and the surgeon&rsquo;s preferences determine the type of cup and the way of attaching the cup. A rounded acetabular insert/liner (which may be plastic or ceramic and would ensure effortless movement in the joint) is inserted inside the acetabular cup. Then the surgeon prepares the femur bone in order to insert the prosthetic femoral stem( a narrow, tapered metal shaft that fits inches down the femur) into it. The top of the stem is created as such to hold a prosthetic ball to replace the femoral head. The ball is then attached to the top of the femoral head, the size of which is already matched to the acetabulum cup and insert. A temporary ball will be inserted by the surgeon to ensure ease of movement and no dislocation. The trial component will then be removed and the final component will be put into place. A check for ease of movement, potential ease of dislocation, and restoration of the natural anatomy of the hip including the leg length, will be made. Through X-rays, proper sizing and position involved of the components will be ensured and any cuts or incisions, previously made, will be fixed altogether completing the procedure. This procedure takes around 1-2 hours of time.</span></p>\r\n',

    treatment_name: "Lung Cancer",
    specilization_id: "2",
    treatment_brief:
      '<h3><strong>Lung Cancer: Introduction!!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lungs are a pair of air-filled organs located on either side of the chest. When you inhale, the air enters your lungs through the trachea (windpipe), where it flows through tubes called bronchi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lung cancer begins from the cells and tissues in the lungs. There are mainly of two types:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the common type of lung cancer and constitutes about 80% of lung cancer cases.</li>\r\n\t<li>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 20% of lung cancer cases.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, mixed small cell/large cell cancer refers to a person who has both types of lung cancer. Furthermore, if cancer begins in other parts of the body and spreads to the lungs, then it is metastatic cancer of the lungs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What Causes Lung Cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly 80 percent of lung cancer deaths happen due to smoking tobacco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smoking is the most significant risk factor for lung cancer, which is also compounded by other variables. Some of the other factors responsible are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Exposure to asbestos</li>\r\n\t<li>Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals such as mustard gas, uranium, radon gas, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>Family history of lung cancer</li>\r\n\t<li>Presence of high arsenic levels in drinking water</li>\r\n\t<li>Inhalation of air pollutants</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Symptoms of Lung Cancer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the early signs of lung cancer are cough (sometimes with blood), weight loss, wheezing, or pain in the chest. These symptoms should not be disregarded and you should also seek medical treatment right once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may also require a medical diagnosis if you may experience the following health conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fatigue or tired</li>\r\n\t<li>Sudden weight loss</li>\r\n\t<li>Breathlessness</li>\r\n\t<li>Coughing out blood or rust-colored phlegm</li>\r\n\t<li>Cough that gets worse over time</li>\r\n\t<li>Loss of appetite</li>\r\n\t<li>Hoarseness</li>\r\n\t<li>Recurrent infections</li>\r\n\t<li>Bronchitis</li>\r\n\t<li>Pneumonia</li>\r\n\t<li>Wheezing</li>\r\n\t<li>Chest pain while laughing or coughing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The symptoms of lung cancer in females are almost the same as those found in men. Somehow, there may be some differences that may affect the treatment options in females</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Stages of Lung Cancer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The chances of survival are better when lung cancer is discovered early. Because lung cancer does not exhibit any symptoms at first, it is only diagnosed after the symptoms become serious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lung cancer has mainly four stages:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1:</strong>&nbsp;It is stage one when cancer begins in the cells and tissues of the lungs.<br />\r\n<strong>2:</strong>&nbsp;When the cancer is in the lungs and nearby lymph nodes it is in stage two<br />\r\n<strong>3:</strong>&nbsp;Cancer is in the lungs and lymph nodes in the middle of the chest. In addition to the lymph nodes, cancer starts spreading to the whole of the chest or the lymph nodes above the collarbone.<br />\r\n<strong>4:</strong>&nbsp;It is considered stage 4 cancer when it has spread to distant organs as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Advanced Treatment Options for Lung Cancer Treatment in India</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment for lung cancer depends on its severity, stage, location, and type of tumor. The treatment options include:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Minimally Invasive Surgery</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, various minimally invasive surgical techniques are being invented to diagnose and also for treat lung cancer. These techniques involve the insertion of a very small video camera through a three-inch incision in the chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surgeons that use minimally invasive surgery can better understand and see the tissue they are working with since they do not have to make big cuts. As compared to traditional surgical techniques, these minimally invasive procedures lead to an accurate surgery followed by quicker recovery time, fewer risks, bleeding as well as discomfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Surgery</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the only last option when all other treatments fail. Based on the nature, severity, stage, location, and size of the tumor, the doctor may perform pneumonectomy &ndash; removal of a lung, lobectomy &ndash; removal of a lobe, or removal of affected lymph nodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this procedure, doctors use anti-cancer drugs to target and also destroy cancerous cells with minimal damage to the nearby cells. These drugs stop cancerous cells from multiplying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors prefer chemotherapy to treat small cell carcinoma &ndash; a type of highly malignant lung cancer that begins in the lungs and can spread to nearby organs such as the prostate, cervix, or gastrointestinal tract. Chemotherapy brings better results when cancer spreads quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Cyberknife Radiosurgery</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://medsurgeindia.com/cost/cyberknife-treatment-cost-in-india/">Cyberknife</a>&nbsp;is a non-invasive therapy that delivers high doses of precisely focused radiation to cure lesions or cancers. It is a non-surgical option to treat complex tumors without surgery or any larger incisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a high-energy radiation treatment to deliver beams of radiation precisely from different angles outside the body. The radiations are so precise that they can match the shape of even small complex tumors near the critical organs. This is why doctors prefer Cyberknife to treat lesions that are inoperable with surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Personalized Targeted Therapy: An Advanced Treatment for Lung Cancer!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Targeted therapy works differently as compared to chemotherapy. Furthermore, targeted treatment can be used in situations when chemotherapy has failed or in conjunction with chemotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes not only do lung cancer treatment procedures kill cancerous cells, but healthy cells as well. A new class of cancer medicines, known as targeted therapies, focuses on not harming healthy cells in the vicinity of the cancerous cells. These therapies stop the growth and functionality of cancerous cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These new anti-cancer drugs interfere with the development of cancer at the molecular level. After diagnosing lung carcinoma with a good tissue biopsy and molecular testing, doctors also ensure about delivering the suitable personalized targeted therapy using biomarkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are the benefits of Minimally Invasive Procedures?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to smaller incisions as compared to traditional open surgeries, minimally invasive procedures have their share of significant advantages and they are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recovery:</strong>&nbsp;As minimally invasive procedures involve lesser and smaller incisions as compared to conventional operating procedures, there are higher chances of the body recovering and healing faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospital Stays</strong>: Minimally invasive procedures require lesser hospital stays and back to life at the earliest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lesser Pain</strong>: As these procedures are less invasive, therefore, they aren&rsquo;t that much pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Less Scarring</strong>: Minimally invasive procedures involve smaller incisions, and hence, less scarring.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why Lung Cancer Treatment in India?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Internationally Recognized &amp; Highly Experienced Pulmonologists:</strong>&nbsp;India, being one of the top medical tourism destinations, has highly qualified surgeons and doctors who have worked with the world&rsquo;s best lung cancer treatment hospitals in the past and holds expertise in treating diseases with the latest cancer treatment techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Affordable, Cost-effective Treatment</strong>: India is well-known for providing world-class, budget-friendly treatment to patients across the globe. The same goes for lung cancer treatment including drugs, medicines, and latest therapies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Comprehensive Care:</strong>&nbsp;Medical equipment such as PET scans, Cyberknifes, IMRTs, IGRTs, Gammaknifes and also Robotic Surgery Systems are available at the hospitals to aid in early diagnosis and faster recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Well-trained Nursing Staff and Other Paramedics:</strong>&nbsp;Highly qualified experts, nurses and paramedics specialise in providing complete care till the patient is totally recovered and released.</p>\r\n',

      "<h3><strong>Can bone cancer be cured completely?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases, bone cancer is easily curable if it hasn&rsquo;t spread. Around 6 in every 10 people diagnosed with bone cancer live for at least five years from the time of their diagnosis. Most often, it may be cured completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is the survival rate of bone cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The survival rate of bone cancer varies according to which extent it has spread. If it is localized, the survival rate is around 91%. If it has spread to nearby tissues or organs, the survival rate is approximately 75%. If it has affected distant organs, the survival rate is quite less which is 22%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Where does bone cancer usually start?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It can develop in any bone in the body, however, it mostly affects the pelvis or long bones in the arms or legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How long does it take to recover from bone cancer surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of a tumor in the leg bone, people start walking again three to six months after a leg amputation, while it takes around a year for complete recovery after limb-salvage surgery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How long is chemo for bone cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The chemo sessions are done for about 10 weeks before undergoing surgery to treat osteosarcomas. This helps make surgery easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What bone cancer patients should eat?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The diet should be rich in protein such as milk products, eggs, legumes, meat, fish, beans, and poultry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Does bone cancer show up on X-rays?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>X-rays can tell any damage to the bones due to cancer or if there is any new bone growing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    treatment_brief:
      "<p>CyberKnife is an exact, painless, and noninvasive radiation therapy which could be a substitute for radiotherapy or to open operation in some specific scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the Cyberknife radiosurgery process, the tumor receives a cumulative dose of radiation to either restrain or destroy the tumor cells while radiation exposure to surrounding tissue is minimized. The Cyberknife can compensate for patient movement to guarantee highly precise delivery of radiation during therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When patient motion happens during therapy, the cameras detect the position shift, along with the robot can compensate for the motion by hammering the LINAC before administering the radiation beam. This practice of correcting for beam replacement guarantees true tumor targeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Understanding the Mechanism</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The exceptional mechanism of this Cyberknife supplies a noninvasive, surgical-like result for lesions of the spine and brain. It&rsquo;s the first and only industrial use of autonomous stereotactic radiosurgery for the spine and the spinal cord. Moreover, this technology has the advantage of allowing the Cyberknife platform to be utilized for radiosurgical programs away from the mind as was for staged radiosurgical procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyberknife radiosurgery has also been effectively utilized to treat chosen lung malignancies. The combo of both investigational hardware and software using Cyberknife technology can provide conformal radiation into transferring primary and metastatic lung tumors if the operation isn&rsquo;t an alternative. The Cyberknife accommodates lung and tumor movement, enabling alterations to be made in order to deliver a maximum therapeutic dose when minimizing surrounding tissue degeneration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cyberknife Disease Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cyberknife intervention is a superb assistance to patients that are handling deadly tumors. Cyberknife can be used to deal with:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Non-Cancerous Tumours</li>\r\n\t<li>Brain Cancer</li>\r\n\t<li>Prostate Cancer</li>\r\n\t<li>Liver Cancer</li>\r\n\t<li>Cancerous Spine Tumours</li>\r\n\t<li>Esophageal cancer</li>\r\n\t<li>Head and Neck Cancer</li>\r\n\t<li>Breast Cancer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

    treatment_faqs:
      "<h3><strong>Q: What is Cyberknife Radiosurgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A: Cyberknife Radiosurgery utilizes focused beams of extreme energy to destroy cancer cells and shrink or restrain the development of tumors. Radiosurgery operates by preventing targeted cells from multiplying. The aim of Radiosurgery would be to destroy the damaging cells while decreasing damage to healthy cells. Cyberknife Radiosurgery might be advocated as a substitute for surgery or in addition to surgery or alternative treatments. Additionally, it may be used to control the pain brought on by lesions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Q: How long does the Cyberknife Radiosurgery usually take?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A: Cyberknife Radiosurgery generally lasts between 30-90 minutes. The time-span of a CyberKnife therapy session is principally determined by the number of beams used to treat the tumor and also the level of movement exhibited by the goal. Typically, tumors may be treated in three remedies, generally on consecutive times and it&rsquo;s uncommon for a remedy to extend past one week.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Q: Do I need Cyberknife Treatment?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A: Cyberknife is a somewhat new noninvasive procedure that simplifies operation and other Radiotherapies to heal tumors in any place within the body. Because it&rsquo;s noninvasive, it does not involve any blood, with hardly any recuperative time. If you would like to learn if Cyberknife therapy is ideal for you, ask your physician or phone a Cyberknife specialist.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Q: How much time will it take to see results?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A: Many Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), such as CyberKnife radiosurgery, are often delivered in 1-5 sessions and require approximately a week to finish. Bear in mind the timeframe varies between individuals and between forms of therapy. For example, neurosurgical treatments like trigeminal neuralgia will see results almost instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Q: What are the side-effects of Cyberknife?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A: The recuperative time-frame for Cyberknife is normally very little. Patients generally, experience very little to no side-effects. Some patients experience nausea and tiredness, however, the cyberknife doctor will explain all prospective side-effects prior to the beginning of the treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Q: Are there any risks associated while traveling?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A: It&rsquo;s ideal to ask your physician for advice on traveling pre or post Cyberknife treatment. But, in the majority of cases, there&rsquo;s not any difficulty in flying after the treatment. We encounter a high number of individuals that travel for Cyberknife therapy in India, remain for a few weeks, and then go back to their home states with no complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Q: How is Cyberknife different from other traditional forms of Radiotherapy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A: There are quite a few similarities between Cyberknife and conventional kinds of Radiotherapy which uses beams of X-rays to ruin the DNA within tumor cells. Nonetheless, in the instance of Cyberknife, the X-ray beams are nicer and stronger. This lets them sculpt considerably more correctly into the form of their tumor. This particular skill of Cyberknife means they may be employed to destroy complicated or inaccessible tumors, which might otherwise be impossible with different kinds of Radiotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Q: Can I go for Cyberknife Treatment while undergoing Chemotherapy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A: Patients now undergoing Chemotherapy or have experienced Chemotherapy previously could be medicated with Cyberknife. It&rsquo;s necessary to say complete patient history together with a various physician before the treatment starts.</p>\r\n",

To establish a path to the spine, an incision is made in the skin and tissues are gently pulled aside. Minimally invasive spine surgery is a technique that reduces the amount of damage to the tissue surrounding the operation site, allowing for a speedier recovery. A catheter is inserted into the tumour location to inject an embolic agent that blocks the vessels supplying the tumour, thereby limiting bleeding. Procedure performed under general anaesthesia. The nerve roots can be exposed and the dura can be identified using the posterior approach. For malignancies in the front of the spine, the anterior approach is used. The incisions are stitched up with sutures or staples following the treatment and are removed 10-14 days later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>After Procedure</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For the next 3-5 days, you will be monitored in the&nbsp;<a href="https://medsurgeindia.com/hospital-department/oncology-and-oncosurgery/">hospital</a>.

ACL is the tissue connecting the thighbone to the shinbone.&nbsp; Most ACL-related injuries occur while playing sports like basketball, skiing, tennis, and football. Some of the symptoms of the injury include joint swelling, a cracking sound during injury, instability of the knee, and pain. An ACL injury cannot heal on its own due to a lack of blood supply to the damaged area, sportspersons, therefore, mostly need to opt for an ACL injury surgery. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">During the ACL reconstruction surgery, you will be under general anaesthesia and hence will be asleep during the whole procedure. Small incisions are made by the surgeon around the knee to create entry portals for various arthroscopic and surgical instruments. Once the arthroscopy is inserted, it delivers a saline solution to create space for surgical tools including the arthroscopic camera, which sends footage to a monitor monitored by the surgeons. He or she then evaluates the structures surrounding the ACL, including the left and right meniscus and the articular cartilage. The surgeon repairs the lesions in the soft tissues, if any. A graft from another part of the patient&rsquo;s body is taken and attached to the end to plugs of bone taken from the patella and tibia. These plugs anchor the graft which will become the new ACL. The new ACL is inserted into the femur and tibia with the help of a flexible guidewire. Then, to secure the wire, screws are used. With time, these plugs grow into the surrounding bone. The surgical instruments are then removed. ACL surgery usually takes about two to two and a half hours of time. </span></p>\r\n',

This includes an elastic bandage wrapped from the ankle to just above the knee, elastic stockings, snug, fitting leggings, or a support hose. After the incisions have healed, apply lotion and gently massage along and across each side of the scar. Some people even suggest that the use of vitamin E can help in minimizing scars even though there is no scientific proof of this.</span></span></p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Acne treatment consists of medication and topical therapies that helps to get rid of the acnes. This treatment works to clear the acnes that occurs due to ingrown hair follicles, oil, dirt and dead cells of the skin that usually clog the pores of the skin and leads to acne formation. There are number of acne treatments available which includes Chemical Peel, Microdermabrasion, Steroid Injections, Laser Skin Resurfacing, Dermabrasion, Intense Pulsed Light, Photodynamic Therapy, Medications (oral and topical) and Home Remedies. The duration of the therapy varies according to the type of medication being used. It is usually of 6 months to more than a year.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Procedure for Acne Treatment</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">The procedure varies according to the type of treatment opted. In Chemical Peel treatment, after properly cleaning the face, a chemical solution (Salicylic acid, Glycolic acid) is applied on the affected area and left for ten minutes. This is followed by application of the neutraliser to minimise the burning sensation caused by the chemical. Lastly, a moisturiser is applied on the skin. This treatment removes the dead skin cells and unclogs pores that cause acne. In the Laser Skin Resurfacing treatment, topical anaesthesia is applied on the skin followed by laser beam that removes the outermost skin layer until a smooth texture of the skin is obtained. In Microdermabrasion, tiny crystals are sprayed over the skin with the help of a hand piece that exfoliate the skin. The duration of this procedure is usually from 30 to 60 minutes. This is a non surgical procedure. Chemical peel procedure is of three types that is Superficial Peels, Medium Peels and Deep Peels.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemical peel procedure starts with the application of chemical peel solution on the skin with help of a brush. The solution is allowed to rest for approximately 10 minutes. This is followed by neutralising solution to neutralise the effect of the chemical being applied. Cold compression is done to avoid any discomfort to skin. Before washing the face and completing the procedure, face mask is applied to sooth the skin surface. The duration of this procedure is quite short (20-30minutes). Photodynamic Therapy is another treatment that is used in case of severe and moderate acne. The procedure starts with application of a photosensitising agent on the skin and dressing the area for nearly 3 hours so that sebaceous glands can absorb it. Then a red or blue light source is targeted on the skin to activate the photosensitising agent that will kill the bacteria, remove the oil by shrinking oil glands. It usually takes two to six weeks to heal the treated areas of the skin completely. Topical Medication involves application of Salicylic acid, Antibiotics (Clindamycin, Benzyl peroxide), Retinoid and Retinoid like products on the skin. These are applied on the on the clean skin surface at night to prevent sun exposure. The duration starts with three times in a week followed by everyday application as the skin become used to it.&nbsp; Oral medications such as Antibiotics, Combined Oral Contraceptives, Anti androgen Agents are Isotretinoin are also included in the treatment regime of acne treatment procedure.</p>\r\n',

The tumour is a result of the malfunction of Schwann cells that form the insulating myelin sheath on the nerves. Normally, Schwann cells protect the nerves which transmit balance and sound information to the brain but mutation in the tumour suppressor gene (NF2) which is located on chromosome 22, leads to abnormal production of the cell protein named merlin in abundance and Schwann cells multiply to form a tumour. As it enlarges, hearing and balance get affected. Although they are non-cancerous, if they grow to press on the cranial nerves and brainstem, they can be life-threatening. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Procedure for Acoustic Neuroma Treatment</span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">A hearing test and imaging using MRI or CT scan are conducted by the doctor to identify your hearing ability and to detect the tumour.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>MONITORING:</strong> This is recommended in the cases where the tumour is slowly growing or not growing at all. It can also be recommended if you&rsquo;re an older adult or not healthy for aggressive treatment.

If the hearing, balance or facial nerves are irritated, the removal of the tumour might cause worsened symptoms. Some complications include leaking cerebrospinal fluid through the wound or nose, ringing in the ear, balance problems and rarely infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis).

Excess consumption of alcohol affects all organs of the body; mostly the liver as it is being given more than it can digest, leading to Alcoholic Liver Disease which further leads to the building of fat, inflammation, and fatalistic scarring in the liver. It is the primary cause of liver disease in Western countries. The alcoholic liver disease begins with a fatty liver and progresses to alcoholic hepatitis (second stage) and finally develops into cirrhosis (final stage). If you have fatty liver disease, which is the first stage of liver damage, the damage will be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least two weeks. If a person has cirrhosis and refrains from alcohol consumption, damage to the liver will stop but the scars would remain. In the case of alcoholic hepatitis, it is mandatory for the patient to abstain from alcohol &ndash; it may lead to improvements but is not sufficient to stop the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Alcoholic Liver Disease Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tests like blood tests, liver function tests, MRI, and liver biopsy might be required. Abstinence of alcohol is vital before starting the treatment of alcoholic liver disease. You can also go for certain therapeutic procedures which are of supportive nature. An aggressive nutritional therapy including an increase in the intake of vitamins and minerals is then recommended by the doctors to rectify malnutrition. Medicines based on the stage and condition are given to the patient after proper screening. For patients with end-stage liver disease, who do not respond to any other treatment, a liver transplant is recommended, the prime eligibility factor being abstinence from alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The exact duration of liver improvement varies from one patient to another, although, you will start seeing beneficial results within a week, just after you stop drinking alcohol.</p>\r\n',

Can liver damage be reversed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>It can only be reversed in the initial stages of liver damage. Cirrhosis indicates late-stage liver disease and cannot be reversed. It is followed usually by an onset of complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q. 6. What are the complications of alcoholic liver disease?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>The complications related to alcoholic liver disease are hepatitis B and C.&nbsp; About 30% of the people would have hepatitis C and the others would have hepatitis B. Also, people with ALD are at a greater risk for liver cancer and about 50% of people have gallstones. The ones with cirrhosis mostly develop kidney problems, internal bleeding, liver cancer, severe infections, and fluid in the belly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q. 7.

    treatment_brief:
      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Bariatric Surgery</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Bariatric Surgery which is commonly known as Weight Loss Surgery is a surgical procedure that helps to shed extra body weight by making changes to the digestive system. It is highly beneficial for the obese patients as it reduces the death rate among them. Duration of the surgery, starting from the time of consultation to the actual surgery is around six month long procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Bariatric Surgery Procedure</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Procedure depends on the types of the bariatric surgery performed. There are basically five main types of bariatric surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sleeve Gastrectomy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This surgery consists of removal of 80 percent of the stomach using surgical staplers. This reduces the area available to the stomach and as a result it carries less amount of food ultimately leading to less intake of food. The metabolism is affected that gives the feeling of full stomach and less hunger. The duration of the surgery is around one to two hours. It is short surgical procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Adjustable Gastic Band</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This treatment procedure involves placement of silicon device in the uppermost part of the stomach creating a small pouch over there that restricts the quantity of food intake a person can have. It takes around an hour and half for the surgery to complete and the patient can be discharged the same day if no complications arise. Chances of re-operation are higher in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Roux-en-Y Gastic Bypass (RYGB)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This is the most commonly performed procedure of bariatric surgery. It is also known by the name of Gastric Bypass surgery. The procedure starts with division of the upper portion of the stomach into a pouch. The bigger part of stomach is not involved that is bypassed followed by division of small intestines and its attachment to the newly formed stomach for the passage of the food. The small size stomach formed after the surgery stores less food and as a result less calorie intake is there by the person. Though being a highly complex procedure, it is a long lasting treatment option for weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Biliopanceatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The surgery involves the formation of sleeve like stomach and then separation of the stomach and small intestine followed by its attachment to the newly formed stomach. When the patient eats something, it will first travel to sleeve pouch of the newly formed stomach and then to the small intestine. Due to the newly formed stomach, the patient will not be eating much food that results in decrease in calorie intake and nutrients and hence controlled body weight. As the intake of nutrients is also decreased, so patient is advised to take vitamins and mineral supplements additionally. This the best treatment option in case of type 2 diabetes patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Single Anastomosisdoudeno-Ilea Bypass with Sleeve Gastrectomy (SADI-S)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This procedure is quite similar to the BPD-DS procedure but takes lesser timer and is simple procedure. In this a small tube shaped stomach is formed followed by division of the small intestines first part and then after measurement, it is attached to the stomach. The treatment works with entrance of food into small pouch of the stomach and thereafter into the latter portion of small intestine where it absorbs nutrients, thus offering energy and a sense of fullness with fewer intakes of calories. The duration of this surgery is around 2 hours and it is done with laparoscopic method and hence is less invasive and the patient is discharged within 2-3 days after the surgery.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q. 1. What is the total duration of the bariatric surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>The operation takes around 2-3 hours to complete and the patient is advised to stay for&nbsp; 5-6 days in the hospital after the surgery,&nbsp; to avoid any complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q. 2. What are possible alternatives available to bariatric surgery to lose weight?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Changes in the lifestyle pattern such as controlled and healthy diet, proper workout and some oral medications for weight loss may be used as an alternative to the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q. 3. How painful is bariatric surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Bariatric surgery is performed under general anesthesia and the patients don&rsquo;t experience any pain during the surgery. However after the surgery,&nbsp; the patient experiences pain at the site&nbsp; where incision is made and also&nbsp; there is abdominal pain that the patient complains of after the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q. 4. What are possible complications that could arise after the bariatric surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Abnormal narrowing of the gastric pouch may occur, followed by abnormal bleeding. There may be some post operative infections that the patient may suffer from. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary problems may arise. There may be possible leakage from the suture lines.</p>\r\n',

It occurs when the body produces an excessive number of dysfunctional white blood cells, interfering with the ability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells and platelets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Depending on leukaemia and other factors, leukaemia treatment might be challenging. However, some methods and resources can aid in the success of your treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Blood Cancer Diagnosis:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">if you have signs or symptoms that hint at leukaemia, you may be referred to a doctor for the following tests: <strong>Physical exam, Blood tests, and Bone marrow test.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedures for Treatment of Blood Cancer:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Procedure for blood and bone marrow cancers is determined by the type of cancer, your age, the rate at which the cancer is spreading, and other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">\r\n\t<p><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> has been categorised to treat all kinds of cancer. Chemicals are used to kill leukaemia cells in this drug treatment. Depending on your leukaemia type, you may be given a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs can be taken as pills or injected straight into a vein.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">\r\n\t<p><strong>Targeted therapy: </strong>Drugs that target specific abnormalities in cancer cells are known as targeted therapy. Targeted medication therapies can kill cancer cells by inhibiting these mutations. Your leukaemia cells will be examined to see if targeted therapy is suitable for you.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">\r\n\t<p><strong>Radiation therapy: </strong>Radiation therapy kills leukaemia cells and prevents their growth by using X-rays or other high-energy beams. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table as a giant machine moves around you, directing the radiation to specific points on your body.You may undergo radiation in a single location of your body where leukaemia cells have clustered, or you may receive radiation all over your body.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">\r\n\t<p><strong>Immunotherapy: </strong>The Immune system plays a crucial role in the treatment of such cancers. Because cancer cells create proteins that assist them in hiding from immune system cells, your body&#39;s disease-fighting immune system may not target your cancer.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">\r\n\t<p><strong>Engineering immune cells to fight Leukaemia: </strong>Chimerical antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a unique treatment that takes your body&#39;s germ-fighting T cells, genetically modifies them to fight cancer, and then reintroduces them into your body.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">\r\n\t<p><strong>Clinical trials: </strong>Clinical trials are research studies used to test new cancer treatments and new ways to use existing ones.

Lymphoma accounts for the bulk (47%) of these diagnoses, followed by leukaemia (36%) and myeloma (18%).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q. 5. When it comes to leukaemia, what&#39;s the difference between chronic and acute leukaemia?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. Acute leukaemia </strong>is a type of leukaemia that develops quickly. The cancer cells are blasts, which are immature blood cells that can&#39;t do their function. The number of these cells is rapidly increasing. If the condition is not treated, it will soon worsen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Chronic leukaemia</strong> generally affects the blood. Although some juvenile blood cells are present, the body produces more mature, functioning cells. The number of explosions is gradually increasing. It takes a lot longer for the condition to progress. The condition can sometimes remain stable for months or even years without treatment.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Bone marrow transplant is a medical treatment that involves the replacement of bone marrow of an individual with the healthy cells. The replacement cells involved in the treatment are either from the donor or from the very own body of an individual. There are other names also that are used for this treatment that are Stem cell Transplant or hematopoietic treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This treatment is indicated in the case of diseases such as Hodgkin&rsquo;s and non Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma, Myeloma, Leukemia where stem cell are taken from the body of the individual itself and Thalassemia,&nbsp; aplastic anemia, chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Relapsed Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia and several other Genetic Disorders with single gene effects, where the stem cells are taken from the donor. The sources of the stem cells include the peripheral blood stem cells, Umbilical cord stem cells and the bone marrow. There are mainly two types of bone marrow transplant. 1) Autologous Transplant: In this procedure the stem cells come from the body of the patient itself. 2) Allogenic Transplant: The stem cells in this procedure are taken from body of the donor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The treatment process does not involve any surgery and is not fatal. The treatment involves infusion of the stem cells into patient via live Blood Transfusion .Once introduced at the target site the stem cells grow in the same manner as the other cells in the human body grow, followed by their division and maturation. Once stem cells develop completely, they start forming the other types of blood cells that are the white blood cells, the red blood cells and platelets. The stem cells have the ability to regenerate within few days. This is the reason for having over 10 million volunteer donors for the bone marrow transplant in the United States of America. To find a donor match is the most important step of this type of transplant. The donor should be a healthy individual whose blood proteins i.e. Human Leukocyte antigens closely resemble the recipient&rsquo;s blood proteins. In many cases finding a suitable donor is not a success, then there other options for that are as follows: 1) Taking stems cells from the umbilical cord. 2) Parent &ndash;child transplant although showing 50 percent match, doctors are using it. The duration of the procedure is around 1-2 hours the patient is kept under observation on the same day of the surgery and is ready to be discharged the very next day.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Brain Cancer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Cancers in the brain result from abnormal growths of cells in the brain. They can arise from primary cells, the cells from other brain elements like membrane or blood vessels, or from other organs&rsquo; cancer cells which spread to the brain (metastatic cancer). All growths in the brain are not cancerous, some can be benign. A malign tumour is composed of cancerous cells and multiplies and spreads aggressively, invading and infecting other organs as well. These tumours are referred to as cancer. The types of brain cancers include primary and metastatic tumours. The tumours which result from the transformation and abnormal growth of brain cells are called primary brain tumours which include gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, and vestibular schwannomas, primary CNS lymphomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumours (medulloblastomas). Metastatic brain tumours emerge from other locations in the body to the brain. These are the most common form of brain tumours and are cancerous as well. Commonly, the cancers starting in the lungs, breasts and kidneys are the ones that spread to the brain. Radiation to the head, hereditary causes, HIV infection, smoking and environmental toxins like the chemicals used in oil refineries and rubber industries are some probable causes of primary brain tumours. The symptoms and warning signs of these tumours are headaches, muscle weakness, paresthesia, clumsiness, difficulty in walking and seizures. Other non-specific brain cancer symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abnormalities in vision, difficulty with speech, gradual changes in intellectual or emotional capacity and altered mental status.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment of Blood Cancer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For the diagnosis, tests like CT scans, blood and liver tests, urine test, blood coagulation tests, MRI and biopsy might be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery for resection of tumour- The aim of the surgery is to minimize brain function damage. For most patients, the surgery is done under general anaesthesia. Other surgeries are done awake or under light sedation to map language functionalities. In the surgeries done under anaesthesia, an endotracheal tube is placed and in the ones where the patient is awake, a laryngeal mask airway (sometimes no airway is placed) is placed and the patient is given sedation. A clamp system holds the skull of the patient and holds the head appropriately.&nbsp; A navigation system guides the surgeons to determine the exact location of the incision. The hair is clipped, the scalp prepared and the incision line is infiltrated with anaesthesia. The scalp is then pushed aside to expose the skull bone. Temporarily, a portion of the skull is removed and the lining tissues of the brain are opened. In case, it is mandatory can you check the brain functioning, patient is awakened in between. Then, a portion of the brain is sent for a checkup to the pathologist. Biodegradable chemotherapy drugs (Wafers) may also be placed inside the tumour by the surgeon. After the tumour resection is complete, the surrounding membranes and the skull are closed with screws and titanium plates that hold it in the desired position. The scalp is then closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Stereotactic radiosurgery- A newer approach to destroying brain cancer without opening the skull is stereotactic radiosurgery. To get the exact point of the tumour CT or MRI scans are done. High energy radiations are then trained on the tumour site which destroys the tumour. The advantages of knifeless surgery include lesser healing time and fewer complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiation therapy- This is a local treatment that harms cells in its way and not the surrounding cells. For patients who cannot undergo surgery due to age, health and other problems, this is the option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; External radiation therapy uses an external machine through which high energy radiation is targeted at the tumour. It travels through the skin, the skull and healthy brain tissue to get at the tumour. The gamma knife and cyberknife are the techniques used to kill the tumour. Each treatment takes only a couple of minutes and is given five days a week for about six weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal/Implant radiation uses a radioactive substance that is implanted in the tumour, the radiations of which destroy the tumour. The patient needs to stay in the hospital for receiving this treatment for several days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy-Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill a tumour. These drugs are given either intravenously through a tube inserted in your vein or orally through the mouth. A single drug or a combination of drugs can be used. Chemotherapy is given in cycles which include a short period of intensive treatment followed by a period of rest and recovery. Each cycle lasts for a few weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Brain Stroke</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It is a medical condition in which improper blood flow to the brain causes cell death. Ischemic stroke is caused due to lack of blood flow and hemorrhagic due to bleeding. Inability to move, loss of vision on one side, and problems understanding or speaking may be some symptoms of a brain stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>PROCEDURE FOR TREATMENT</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>For an Ischemic Stroke:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">1. Emergency IV medication- An IV injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which is also terme alteplase (Activase) or tenecteplase (TNKase)is the gold standard treatment for ischemic stroke but has to be given within 4.5 hours of when the symptoms started through a vein in the arm. This drug dissolves the blood clot causing the stroke and also helps you to recover from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">2. Emergency endovascular procedures &ndash; These procedures are done directly inside the blocked blood vessels. These are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Medications delivered directly to the brain&ndash;A long, thin tube (catheter) is inserted through an artery in the groin and is threaded to the brain to deliver TPA directly at the location of the stroke. The time period for this is longer than the time period for injected TPA but is limited still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Removing the clot with a stent retriever &ndash;Doctors may use a catheter to directly remove the clot from the blocked blood vessel in the brain. This process is mostly performed in combination with injected TPA and is helpful to remove clots that cannot be removed by TPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>For a Hemorrhgic Stroke:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery&ndash;For a large area of bleeding, doctors would recommend surgery to remove the blood and relieve the brain. It may also be used to relieve blood vessel problems related to hemorrhagic strokes. The surgery usually takes about 2 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgical clipping &ndash;A tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm is placed by the doctor to stop the blood from flowing into it. This clamp can keep the aneurysm from bursting or from bleeding again. It must be done within 72 hours of the bleed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Coiling (endovascular embolization) &ndash;The surgeon places tiny detachable coils into the aneurysm to fill it using a catheter inserted into an artery in the groin guided to the brain which causes the blood flow in the aneurysm to stop and form a blood clot. The process usually takes 2-4 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgical AVM removal &ndash;If the AVM is located in an accessible area of the brain the surgeons may remove it. It reduces the chances of rupture and lowers the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. It is not possible to remove an AVM if it is present deep within the brain or if it is large as it could cause a deep impact on the brain. The procedure can take 3 to 8 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Stereotactic radio surgery &ndash;It is an advanced, minimally invasive treatment, used to repair blood vessel malformations. It takes about less than an hour to around four hours.</p>\r\n',

What are the types of stroke?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ans.</strong> A brain stroke can occur in two ways &ndash; ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. In an ischemic stroke, a blood clot blocks a blood vessel or artery in the brain. About 80% of strokes are ischemic. In the other 20% of brain strokes which are hemorrhagic, a blood vessel or artery breaks and bleeds into the brain. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    treatment_brief:
      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Brain Tumour</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When abnormal cells develop within the brain, tumours are formed. They can be cancerous or non-cancerous. Primary tumours start within the brain and secondary tumours start from tumours outside the brain. The cause of most brain tumours is unknown. The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending upon the type, size and location of the tumour in the brain. Some warning signs and symptoms include seizures, difficulty in sleeping, memory problems, headaches, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, sensory (vision, smell and hearing) changes, personality changes or mood swings, difficulty performing mundane activities and drowsiness. The different types of brain tumours which exist are Medulloblastomas, Pituitary adenomas, Acoustic neuromas, Meningiomas, Germ cell tumours, Craniopharyngiomas and Gliomas. Exposure to radiation and family history are some factors that may increase your risk of getting a brain tumour.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>PROCEDURE FOR TREATMENT </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For the diagnosis, your doctor might ask you to get tests like MRI scans, CT scans and neurologic exams done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For the treatment, there are several options like radiation therapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Most of the time, you could get a combination of all of these depending upon the type, size, location of the tumour and the patient&rsquo;s age and health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery&ndash;Before the surgery, your scalp is shaved. There is complete or partial resection of the tumour with the objective being the removal of as many tumour cells as possible. If the tumour is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgery may not be possible. Though the recovery time differs from person to person, you will have to spend a few days in the hospital. Surgery typically takes about 4 to 6 hours of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiotherapy- Radiation therapy usually follows surgery. It includes killing tumour cells with powerful rays like x-rays, gamma rays or protons. It can be either external or internal. In external radiotherapy direct beams are aimed at the entire brain or a part of the brain with the help of a large machine. The schedule depends upon the type and size of the tumour and the age of the person. In internal radiation therapy, seeds are implanted inside the brain to give off radiation for months. Radiotherapy treatments spread out over weeks and each treatment generally takes about 10 to 30 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy- It is sometimes used to treat brain tumours and includes giving drugs orally or intravenously through a thin short tube that goes into your vein or through a long central line ( a PICC) put into a large vein in your chest or you could get chemotherapy through wafers (chemotherapy implants) or Ommaya reservoirs (in this treatment a plastic dome is placed under your scalp and chemotherapy is given straight into the fluid spaces in your brain). It may be given with or after radiotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You will need regular check-ups after the treatment to ensure your health. Chemotherapy would typically last for 6-12 months with 6-12 cycles.</p>\r\n',

    specilization_id: "4",
    treatment_brief:
      '<p><span style="font-size:11pt">It is a broad term encompassing a vast array of different types of surgery on the hand. Plastic surgeons performing hand surgery make an attempt to restore the function of the hand as well as try to maximize the cosmetic appearance of the hand. Hand surgery may be done for various reasons, including, but not limited to trauma to the hand, rheumatic changes to the structures in the hand, congenital (present at birth) deformities, and infections. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Tendon repair surgery- &nbsp;A tendon repair surgery involves a surgeon making an incision in your wrist, hand or finger to locate the ends of the divided tendon and to stitch them together.Extensor tendons are much easier to reach, and hence repairing them is relatively straightforward.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Nerve repair surgery- Normally, you are under general anaesthesia for a nerve repair surgery, therefore you can expect no pain during the procedure. A powerful microscope is used to examine the injured nerves. The surgeon then derides torn tissue or scar tissue from the ends. The method used to depends upon the location and the cause of the pain. If there is enough length on the ends of the nerve in order to reconnect it without stretching, the surgeon goes on to take that approach. This is the most straightforward nerve repair procedure. &nbsp;But if the doctor has to take a significant amount of tissue from the nerve, creating a gap which cannot be reconnected, a nerve from your leg or arm is harvested to place in the space in between. This procedure is called nerve grafting. </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Closed reduction and fixation- This surgery helps in realignment of the broken bone and also holds it in place, or immobilizes it, while it heals. Immobilization can be done with internal fixtureswith wires, rods, splintsand casts.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Surgical drainage or debridement- In skin debridement, the skin surrounding the sore/wound is cleaned and disinfected and the wound is probed with a metal instrument fordetermining its depth and to look for foreign material or objects in the ulcer. The hyperkeratosis, infected, and nonviable tissue is excised and the ulcer is washed out.Patients undergoing percutaneous abscess drainage are usually hospitalised. This procedure uses imaging guidance to place a needle or catheter through the skin into the abscess to remove or drain the infected fluid. This treatment offers faster recovery than open surgical drainage. </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Carpal tunnel surgery- During a carpal tunnel release, an incision is made in the palm of your hand over the carpal tunnel ligament by the surgeon. He then cuts through the ligament to relieve pressure on the median nerve. The surgery could be done by making one incision on the palm side of the wrist, or by making several small incisions.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Skin graft surgery- For a split-thickness graft the surgeon would use skin from an area of your body which is usually hidden by clothing like your hip or the outside of your thigh, whereas for a full-thickness graft the surgeon will use your abdomen, groin, forearm, or area above the collarbone as the donor site. The removed skin will then be placed over the transplant site carefully and will be secured with a surgical dressing, staples, or stitches. In case of a split-thickness graft the graft will be meshed in multiple slits which allows fluid to drain from under the skin graft. &nbsp;After the procedure is completed, the surgeon will dress the donor area with a dressing which does not stick to the skin. </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Trigger finger surgery:</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">Open surgery- A mild sedative is given to you by the surgeon through an IV line to help you relax. The surgeon then numbs the area by injecting a local anesthetic into your hand. An incision of about half an inch is madein your palm, in line with the affected finger or thumb. After that the surgeon cuts the tendon sheath which can impede movement if it becomes too thick. The doctor moves your finger around to ensure smooth movement. Finally, you get some stitches to close the small cut. The procedure takes from a few minutes to half an hour.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Percutaneous release- This procedure is commonly performed for middle and ring fingers. The doctor numbs your palm using an anesthetic, then inserts a sturdy needle into the skin around the affected tendon. The doctor then moves the needle and your finger around to break apart the blocked area.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n',

      '<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.1. What are some complications related to trigger finger surgery?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans.</strong> The chances of complications after a trigger finger surgery are minimal but could be - nerve damage, bowstringing, when too much of the sheath is cut, persistent triggering, incomplete extension when the sheath stays tight beyond the part that was released. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.2. What happens after hand surgery?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans.</strong> You can expect physical therapy soon after the procedure. Hand exercises that you can perform easily at home will be taught, with the purpose of gradually gaining strength, flexibility, and range of motion again. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.3. How long is the recovery likely to last?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans.</strong> The length of the recovery period depends completely on the type of surgery performed and on the patient as well. Generally, it takes two to four months to heal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.4. What are the risks of hand surgery?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans.</strong> Most surgeries carry risks related to anesthesia and bleeding. The additional risk depends upon the type of surgery being performed and includes infection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.5. Can you use your hand after surgery?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><strong>Ans.</strong> Patients should refrain from using their hands in a manner not recommended by their surgeons during their recovery period which generally is 2 to 4 months long.</span></p>\r\n',

      '<p><span style="font-size:11pt">A heart transplant is a major open-heart surgery that is performed to replace the diseased or defected heart of the patient with a new heart from the donor that has been declared brain dead. This is the last and most reliable treatment procedure of heart when all other options have failed to work. The major&nbsp; reason for the Heart Transplant surgery is the failure of the heart that has reached to the last stage. This could be due the reason that the heart muscles have become so weak that they are not able to pump blood. Heart transplant is indicated in case of&nbsp;&nbsp; Myocardial Infarction, Congenital defect in the heart,viral infection of the heart and in case of chronic &nbsp;lung disease.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure for the Heart Transplant </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">The procedure of the Heart Transplant surgery consist of the following steps</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">1. Checking if the of the candidate can undergo &nbsp;heart transplant on the basis of the blood tests and , diagnostic tests performed. Blood test help in matching the donor easily.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">2.After all the test result are found to be in favour of the heart transplant, the search of the suitable donor organ begins for the patient. This search period for the donors organ can be long as the number of the patients who need heart transplant are way more than the number of available donors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">3.Once a suitable donors organ is found, based upon the size of the body and the blood group matching, candidate matching the donors organ is finalised.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">4. The procedure starts with giving general anaesthesia to the patient. After that catheters are placed at the suitable locations to monitor the patients heart status, and to take blood samples during the surgery. To give &nbsp;medicine an intravenous fluid throughout the surgery , intravenous catheter is given. It is made sure to drain the fluid from the stomach and urine from the bladder via flexible tube inserted in the stomach and mouth. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">5.Incision is given in the centre of the chest to reach the heart via the rib cage. The diseased heart of the patient is removed by cutting off the blood vessels connecting to the heart.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">6. After removing the diseased heart of the patient within 4 hours, after the donors heart is removed from the donor, is placed in the patient and it is now connected to the blood vessels.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">The transplanted heart starts beating when the surgeon gives shock to heart. The is observed for a while immediately after the surgery to check the working of the new heart.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">7.Incisions are closed thereafter and dressing is given.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">After the transplant is completed is patient is kept in the intensive care unit to check all the vitals throughout the period and ECG is observed regularly.Until the patient is not stable enough breathing tubes are not removed. Once the patient starts breathing and responding on their own,breathing tubes are removed. Diagnostic tests and blood tests are repeated after the surgery to check the proper functioning of the new heart.Pain killers are given to control the pain that the patient experience while coughing and breathing after the heart transplant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The procedure takes around 4 -5 hours. The patient has to stay in the hospital under observation for attest 14 days and the duration may be more depending upon the condition of the parent after the surgery. Medications after the heart transplant surgery is given to the patient are Immunosuppressive drugs after the heart transplant. These drugs help the immune system not to attack the new heart as it will recognise the new heart as a foreign body and as a result may try to harm it.</span></p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Breast augmentation is also called augmentation mammoplasty, breast augmentation is a cosmetic surgery to increase breast size by placing breast implants under the breast tissues or muscles. In surgical breast implantation, the augmentation created of the breast hemisphere is spherical, using an implant filled with either a saline solution or silicone gel. However, in the fat-graft transfer approach, it is the contour defects of the breast hemisphere that is augmented using the grafts of the adipocyte fat tissue drawn from the person&rsquo;s body itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">The surgery begins with anesthesia. You will be given either intravenous or general anesthesia based on your body. Incisions are made in unobtrusive areas to minimize visible scarring. Your surgeon would discuss with you the possible incision options which include - along the areolar edge (peri-areolar incision), the fold under the breast (inframammary fold), and in the armpit (axillary incision). When complication rates are high, a belly-button approach is taken up. After the incision is made, the breast implant is inserted into a pocket either under the pectoral muscle which is a submuscular placement, or directly behind the breast tissue over the pectoral muscle which is a Submammary/Subglandular placement. The method of inserting the implant is decided by the surgeon based on the type of implant, the degree of enlargement desired, and your body type. Lastly, incisions are closed with layered sutures in the breast tissue and with sutures, skin adhesive, or surgical tape. Over time the incisions fade away based on the exposure to infection and nicotine and your genetics as well. The procedure takes around 45 minutes to an hour. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',

While in IMRT, advance technology is used to direct the beams of radiation directly to the tumour to decrease the side effects, in proton therapy, protons are used in place of X-rays. Proton therapy is not yet the standard mode and is being studied thoroughly. Before radiation therapy the dentist must check for any spoiled teeth because during radiation therapy many spoiled teeth get decayed. The treatments are given once or twice a day for five days a week for five to seven weeks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><u>Therapies using medication-</u>Medication is given either intravenously through a tube connected to a vein or orally using pills. The medications used for head and neck cancer are:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Chemotherapy- In chemotherapy drugs are used to destroy the cancer cells. It usually keeps them from growing or completely destroys them. Chemotherapy is given in cycles over a period of time and one drug or a combination of drugs might be used. It is given for a total of 3 to 6 months.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Targeted therapy- In this treatment the specific genes, proteins or the surrounding area of the tumour which contribute to it&rsquo;s growth are targeted and are destroyed. This technique inhibits the growth of the cancer and limits the damaged to the healthy cells. The doctor may ask for tests to identify the genes and proteins.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">EGFR inhibitors &ndash;The tumour protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), when, is targeted and blocked, results in the stoppage or slow growth of certain types of head and neck cancers.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Tumour-agnostic therapy - Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) is not specific to a certain type of cancer. It focuses on a specific genetic change in the NTRL genes. Larotrectinib is approved for metastatic head and neck cancer which cannot be removed with surgery and has worsened with other treatments.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Immunotherapy-&nbsp;</span></u><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Also called biologic therapy, immunotherapy boosts up the body&rsquo;s ability to fight cancer by either improving or restoring the immune system function by using materials made in the body or in the laboratory. For the treatment of people with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squalors cell carcinoma, Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Many people stay on immunotherapy for up to two years.&nbsp;For the treatment of metastatic head and neck cancer, a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy may be recommended by your doctors.</span></p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Breast cancer is the type of cancer that starts either in one or both the breasts. When there is an abnormal growth of cells, cancer begins. A tumour in the breast can be benign or cancerous. A benign tumour is harmless but can increase the risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer mainly occurs in women but can occur in men too. The Breast can start from different parts of the breast like the lobules, ducts, nipple, the fat and connective tissue or the blood and lymph vessels. A small number of cancers begin in other parts of the breast known as sarcomas and lymphomas. Breast cancer can spread if the cancer cells move into the blood or the lymph system, travelling to other parts of the body. If the cancer cells have entered the lymph nodes, there is a probability of cancer reaching the other parts of the body as well. But, not every woman with cancer cells in her lymph nodes gets metastases and some women even get metastases later when there are no cancerous cells in her lymph nodes. The types of cancers in the breast include carcinomas (adenocarcinomas and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) being the most common), angiosarcoma and sarcoma. Angiosarcoma and sarcoma are not considered breast cancers as they start from different cells in the breast. Certain causes of breast cancer remain unknown but the risk factors include drinking alcohol, obesity, not being active physically, not having children, not breastfeeding, birth control, menopause hormone therapies and breast implants. The risks which are non-changeable are being female, getting older, having a family history of breast cancer, inheriting certain gene changes, race and ethnicity, having dense breast tissue and having benign breast conditions like non-proliferating lesions and proliferating lesions with atypia. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Surgery- Surgery is the removal of the tumour and a little surrounding tissue as well. It is also used to examine the auxiliary lymph nodes nearby, under the arm. The smaller the tumour,&nbsp; more the options available for the patient.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Breast-conserving surgery or Lumpectomy- In this procedure the tumour along with a little margin of the healthy tissue is removed, leaving behind most of the breast. The procedure is done under general anaesthesia which puts you in a sleep-like state. The surgeon will make a small incision over the area containing the wire ( which was inserted to locate the tumour). He/she will then remove the tumour with some of the surrounding tissue and send it further for lab analysis. If you are having a sentinel node biopsy or the axillary lymph node dissection, he will do the same for the sentinel lymph node and the axillary lymph node. The incision will then be closed, keeping in check the appearance of the breast using stitches. Adhesive strips may also be used by the surgeon to keep the stitches in place temporarily until they heal. The procedure takes about one hour to complete.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Mastectomy- It is an umbrella term for the removal of one or both the breasts along with the lymph nodes. You are given general anaesthesia and the surgeon starts by making an elliptical incision around your breast. Depending upon the tumour, different parts of your breast are removed. After the surgery and after the procedure of breast reconstruction (if you choose to get it done), the incisions are closed with sutures that may dissolve later on or will be removed. Tubes will be placed where your breast was removed to remove any fluids that accumulate after the surgery. The operation takes around 90 minutes and you can expect the healing time to be 4 to 6 weeks. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Sentinel node biopsy-You will probably be under general anaesthesia. The surgeon will make an incision in the area above the lymph nodes. If the radioactive solution is used before the procedure, a small instrument called the gamma detector will be used by the surgeon to determine if radioactivity has accumulated for identifying the sentinel nodes. Blue die stains the sentinel nodes bright blue and helps the surgeon to see them. Then the sentinel nodes are removed by the surgeon. There are one to five sentinels in every case. The treatment takes around 45 minutes of time. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Axillary lymph node dissection-You will be under general anaesthesia while your doctor makes an incision under the arm and removes 10 to 40 lymph nodes of levels 1 and 2. After the removal of the lymph nodes, the surgeon places a drain and closes the cut with stitches or staples. To collect the draining fluid and to improve the healing process, a drainage bag is attached to the drain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Radiation therapy-In radiation therapy, high powered radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays are used to kill cancer. It can be done using a machine (external therapy) or using wafers that are implanted in the tumour (internal radiation therapy). Generally, after a lumpectomy, external beam radiation of the whole breast is used. Breast cancer radiation treatment can last from three days to six weeks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Chemotherapy-The process of usage of a single or a combination of drugs to fight cancer cells is called chemotherapy. The drugs are given intravenously or orally. If there is a chance that your cancer will return after the surgery, your doctor will recommend chemotherapy to you. It is done in cycles with one sitting and then a period of rest. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Hormone therapy- It is done when the cancers are sensitive to hormones. Medications can be given that block hormones from attaching to cancer cells or inhibit the body from producing estrogen after menopause or stop hormone production in the ovaries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Targeted therapy- In this treatment, the genes, proteins or the tissue environment of cancer which contributes to its growth and survival is targeted. HER2 targeted therapy in which drugs like trastuzumab, pertuzumab, neratinib and ado-trastuzumab emtansine are used.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Immunotherapy- This treatment uses materials from either the patient&rsquo;s body or from the outside are used to improve the immune system of the body of the patient. Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy approved by the FDA to treat early-stage, triple-negative, high-risk breast cancer in combination with chemotherapy before surgery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">This surgery is also known as reduction mammaplasty, breast reduction surgery is a procedure to remove excess fat, skin and glandular tissue from your breasts which cause pain in your neck and back, chronic rash under your breasts, restricted activity and nerve pain, and are not in proportion with the rest of your body. It is done to alleviate the discomfort caused by macromastia (excessively large breasts). Mostly, mammaplasty is done regarding concern for medical issues related to large breasts and the problems which they pose in the daily lives of the patients but women who are unhappy with the size of their breasts can get it done for cosmetic purposes as well. Most women who get the surgery are highly satisfied with the results. Men with conditions like gynecomastia -where male breasts are abnormally enlarged, can also have it</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Before the treatment, your doctor will talk to you about your medical history, if you have had a lump removed from your breast earlier or any other medications affecting your breasts. You may also get a mammogram and a breast exam before the procedure. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Anesthesia is administered as the first step and your choices include intravenous or general anesthesia. Incisions are either made in a circular pattern around the areola, like a keyhole with an incision around the areola or vertically down to the breast crease, in an inverted T (anchor-shaped) pattern. After the incision is made, the nipple is repositioned while it remains connected to its original nerve and blood supply. The breast tissue underneath is reduced, lifted and reshaped. For large pendulous breasts, occasionally, the nipple would need to be removed and placed in a higher position on the breast. The incisions are then brought together and closed to reshape the now smaller breast. For supporting the reshaped breasts, sutures are layered deep within the breast tissue. Sutures, surgical tape and skin adhesives are used to close the skin. Incision lines are permanent but improve over time and fade away in most cases. A breast reduction surgery may take about two to five hours of time or even more sometimes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',

A smooth metal cap will then be attached with surgical cement to the ball. Then a metal shell is pushed into the hip socket with a roughened back which attaches itself to the pelvic bone. The femoral head is moved into the socket. Finally, the incision is stitched. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The whole procedure takes around two hours. You will be required to spend a day or two in the hospital and you will be allowed to go home after the doctor approves your condition.</span></p>\r\n',

      '<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.1. What is the cost of hip resurfacing surgery?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans.</strong> The average cost of hip resurfacing surgery in India is around 3-3.5 lakhs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.2. For how long will I be in the hospital?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans. </strong>The patient will be asked to stay in the hospital for 2 to 3 days after the treatment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.3. How much time does it take to recover from a hip resurfacing surgery?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans. </strong>You can expect pain or discomfort for several weeks after the surgery. A vast majority of patients recover within months and return to their daily routine and activities within months after the surgery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.4. What will happen when the hip resurfacing wears out?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans. </strong>When this happens, it can be converted to a traditional total hip replacement with a stem in the thigh bone, utilising a big metal ball to match your socket.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.5. What are the major benefits of hip resurfacing?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans. </strong>Preservation of the bone is one major factor of hip resurfacing over hip replacement. It also has a ball of greater diameter which provides greater theoretical range of motion. It is also more stable and the dislocation rate is lower as compared to the traditional hip replacement surgery. You can also return to more impact activity as the hip resurfacing loads the bone of the femur the way it is in your own hip.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.6. What are the complications that could arise after a hip resurfacing surgery?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Ans. </strong>The complications which arrive are rare but can include infection for which you will be given antibiotics before and after the surgery, blood clots which form in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis after surgery, injury of nerves and vessels, femoral neck fracture, dislocation and risks of anaesthesia. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Q.7. Why should I have a hip resurfacing vs. a traditional total hip replacement?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Ans.</span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Both of these are designed to improve the functioning of your body and to decrease the pain. For patients with a higher demand of impact activities, hip resurfacing would be a better option. For people who want to preserve the bone, generally the young group, resurfacing would be an excellent choice but for a person for whom the traditional total hip replacement surgery could last the rest of his/her life, total hip replacement could be the option.</span></p>\r\n',

The surgical technique followed may be either conventional or minimally invasive technique. Before the surgery began, it is made sure that the patient is fit enough for the surgery by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, chest X-rays, Electrocardiogram and physical examination of the patient. Complete medical history of the patient is taken which includes drug allergies, any minor or serious medical condition and any bad habits such as smoking. Patient is advised not to eat anything at least 8-10 hours before the surgery. The patient is connected to the ventilator and breathing tube is inserted into the mouth. Ventilator and heart/lung bypass machine is used as the heart is stopped while the surgery and circulation and vitals are maintained via ventilator and heart-lung bypass machine. Incision is given on the chest region. The length of the incision depends upon the method of surgical procedure chosen. For minimally invasive surgery small length incision is given. In Open heart surgery the length of incision is bigger. This is followed by removal of the diseased heart valve and placement of artificial valve at its place. After the surgery is completed, Heart is restarted by giving shock to the heart via small paddles. Now the blood that was circulating with the help of heart -lung bypass machine is made to re-enter heart. When the heart starts beating normally, it observed for a while to check it&rsquo;s proper working and the working of the new valve placed. The incision is sutured and sterile bandage is applied over it.</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">After the surgery, patient is kept under observation in the intensive care unit for several days. ECG, blood pressure oxygen level, heart rate and breathing rates are monitored continuously. The patient becomes stables after the breathing and stomach tubes are removed. The duration of the treatment is usually 3hours or may be longer. Complications associated with the surgery include bleeding during or after the surgery, blood clot, breathing problem, pneumonia, pancreatitis, Arrhythmias and sometimes death. Patient is advised to immediately consult the doctor if he or she have high fever, swelling and drainage from the incision site, Redness, pain around the incision site and rapid or irregular pulp.</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p><span style="font-size:11pt">Intraperitoneal hyperthermia chemo perfusion is a type of hyperthermia therapy used to treat advanced abdominal cancers in combination with surgery. It is a surgery which is used to treat abdominal cancers which have spread from their organ of origination using high doses of chemotherapy which are delivered to the abdomen. The cancers which have spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity are difficult to treat through a traditional chemotherapy. HIPEC surgery can be effective in such cases. It is a two-step procedure involving a cytoreductive surgery and a hipec surgery. The most common cancers treated through HIPEC surgery are appendix cancer, colon and rectal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, mesothelioma, adrenal cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic and peritoneal cancer. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">All visible tumours are first removed from the abdomen by the surgeons through a technique called tumour debunking or cytoreductive surgery. The extent of this surgery is decided by the amount of tumour in the patient&rsquo;s abdomen. Surgeons delicately remove any visible tumours in the abdomen which could even include involved organs. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">During the second phase of the surgery (HIPEC), a heated sterile solution containing a chemotherapeutic agent is constantly circulated through the peritoneal cavity. It is heated chemo, hence it penetrates the tissue. Surgeons rock the patient back and forth to make certain that the remaining cancer cells come in contact with the solution. It is done for 2 hours continuously. The combination of chemotherapy and heat which is delivered directly to the abdomen proves to be more effective than the traditional chemotherapy treatment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">With the help of this procedure, the chemo can be delivered directly where the tumour cells are and do not therefore affect the body with any side effects. The operation can be time consuming as the tumour removal process, based on how many tumours are to be removed, takes anywhere from one hour to eight hours and the chemotherapy application takes two hours more.</span></p>\r\n',

      '<p><span style="font-size:11pt">&nbsp;Interventional Cardiology is a branch of cardiology that treats the diseased heart with the help of a catheter based treatment technique. This technique has a benefit of causing minimal scar and pain and avoiding long term recovery period. Angioplasty is the process of opening of the blocked arteries of the heart. It is one of the procedure of interventional cardiology. In angioplasty, a catheter with is balloon is inserted at the site of the clogged artery and then inflated there. This causes widening of the artery thus making way for the unobtrusive blood flow.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure of Interventional Cardiology </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>1. Balloon Angioplasty </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">This procedure of interventional cardiology starts with giving anaesthesia to the patient followed by giving incision in the chest region and reaching the heart and then insertion of catheter with a balloon at its tip into the region of the blocked artery in the heart. The balloon attached to the catheter is then inflated at the region of the blocked artery which compresses the observation in the artery or the plaque and widening the artery diameter which increases the flow of the blood to the heart. This technique is known as per cutaneous coronary intervention. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>2. Rot Ablation</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">In this procedure, Catheter having acorn shaped with diamond quoted tip is used. The tip is made to spin at a high speed at the site of the blocked artery thus grinding away the collected plaque at the artery. The process is repeated until all the plaque that cause blockage is removed. This procedure is known as per cutaneous Trasnsluminal Rotational Atherectomy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>3. Balloon angioplasty with Stenting</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">This technique involves placing a stent with the help of catheter at the site of the blockage of the artery. The Catheter will be removed thereafter after the placement of the stent at the blockage site. The artery around the stunt will be free of obstruction with time. This technique is used in case of more than one coronary artery blockage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>4. Drug Eluting Stents (DES)</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">This procedure makes use of drug along with the stent placement. The drug is released at the site of stent placement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>5. Cutting Balloon </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">Cutting balloon technique makes use of Cather that has small blades along with balloon tip. These blades will cut away the plaque at the site of obstruction and thus make way for the blood flow through the artery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">After the procedure is complete the patient is advised to take rest and is kept under observation for s day or two in the hospital after the surgery. The patient can return back to normal routine within a week or maximum 10 days. There are many complications that may arise after the surgery that includes bleeding at the site where catheter was inserted, discomfort at the site of catheter insertion, fever and redness, drainage from the site of incision, chest lain and breathless. Drugs used during the interventional cardiology include anti platelet drugs such as aspirin thienopyridine and glycoproteins and anti thrombotic drugs.</span></p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Leukaemia is the cancer of blood-forming tissues including the bone marrow and obstructs the ability of the body to fight against infections. Various symptoms for the identification of leukemia include getting tired easily, pale skin tone, fever, easy bleeding, easy bruising and nosebleeds, bone or joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, groin, or stomach, frequent infections,&nbsp; weight loss, shortness of breath, night sweats and little energy and weakness. Lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are the types of leukemia that can be treated through different treatment options available including radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplant (bone marrow transplant). Chemotherapy is the most common form of treatment for cancer including most types of Leukemia as well. It aims at destroying cancer, prolonging life or relieving its symptoms by shrinking tumors that cause pain through variable combinations of medicines/ potent drugs or chemicals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Procedure for Treatment</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">You may receive chemotherapy at home, in a doctor&rsquo;s office or in a hospital. Based on the type and stage of the blood cancer, the patients receive chemotherapy by mouth, as a cream, through a catheter, or intravenously (through an IV). Some chemotherapy drugs are taken in the form of capsules, some are given by inserting a tube with a needle into a vein or into a device in a vein in your chest. The treatment is cyclic - you can get it every day, week, or month. The body of the patient is given sufficient time to heal, strengthen and build healthy cells. A basic chemo regimen lasts for 5 minutes to 8 or more hours. Deciding the dosage of chemotherapy can be problematic - a low dosage could be ineffective and the toxicity of high dosage could be intolerable for the patient. Due to the lack of a better option, the BSA formula has been adopted since 1950 to determine the adequate dosage for chemotherapy. Measuring the blood levels in the blood plasma over time according to a formula or algorithm can help in achieving optimal exposure. Dosing is personalized to achieve target exposure and optimal results.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Chemotherapy is an undoubtedly effective treatment but has many side effects, the most common being the destruction of fast-dividing cells of the body - cells lining the mouth, stomach and intestines and blood cells resulting in side effects like nausea, extreme hair fall, vomiting and fatigue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">The cycle of Chemotherapy varies from once every week or once every three weeks. The treatment may go up to three to four months but the doctor will adjust the timings according to your situation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">The patients with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) and ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) usually receive the treatment in two phases:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">1. Induction therapy-Patients go through various cycles of treatment in the hospital and will spend four to six weeks undergoing the therapy. Induction therapy attempts to kill as many AML and ALL cells as possible with chemotherapy and to get rid of any signs of disease left in the body. It also aims at bringing back the blood count of the body to normal. One cycle generally consists of a week of receiving drugs followed by many weeks of recovery and resting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">2. Post Remission Therapy-After the completion of Induction therapy, patients still need to undergo additional therapy which is post remission therapy, also known as consolidation therapy. If you skip this step, chances of the cancer returning are high. The therapy includes chemotherapy and a sometimes a stem transplant as well. Its purpose is to destroy the stray leukemic cells not found by any blood or marrow tests. You can get this done in a hospital or an outpatient setting over a period of four to six weeks or longer depending upon the treatment and it&rsquo;s side-effects. The overall health and the availability of a stem cell donor determine the type of post-remission therapy that patients need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p><span style="font-size:11pt">Intrauterine Insemination is a minimally invasive and cost effective treatment procedure for infertility in which, sperms are placed directly into the uterus via a catheter during the ovulation cycle of the female. Intrauterine Insemination treatment is done in the cases where the sperm count is low, in endometriosis, ejaculation dysfunction and single females who want to conceive without sexual intercourse.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure for Intrauterine Insemination Treatment </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">Before the actual procedure start various diagnostic tests such as blood tests and ultrasound are carried out. This is done to determine the period of ovulation. The procedure starts with the collecting the semen from the male partner. Then the sperms are collected from the semen sample. This is followed by washing of the sperm samples. Washing of the sperms is done because there is a non sperm element that is present in the semen. This non sperm element has the ability to cause infection the female and thus effect the fertilisation process. After washing of the sperms, the aim of the treatment is to collect the small, high quality and highly concentrated sperms from the samples. The small, normal looking and the highly active sperm is chosen. The purpose of the selecting a highly active and good quality sperm is to increase the success rate of the treatment procedure as it boosts the chances of conceiving. After this the female partner is injected with Human Gonadotropin Hormone. The hormone injection is given to release the egg. After the eggs are released, the doctor will now inject the sperm sample collected into the lining of the uterus via a catheter that is long thin tube, by gently opening the vagina and viewing the cervix. The sole purpose of the procedure is to decrease the time and the amount of distance that the sperm has to travel to reach the egg and fertilise it. After two weeks of the Intrauterine Insemination, pregnancy tests are performed to check the success of the treatment procedure. If the pregnancy test comes negative, patient is advised to go for the second cycle of Intrauterine Insemination without losing hope. Maximum of 3-6 cycles of the Intrauterine Insemination are performed and if results are negative, then the patient is advised to go for In vitro Fertilisation. This is a non invasive procedure and first and the best treatment option for infertility problem but the results may vary according the patient. It may helps in fertilisation in some cases and in other cases where this treatment does not respond well, other options such as In vitro fertilisation may be used. The cost of the treatment is quite less compared to other treatment options. It is usually between 4000-5000 rupee for the single cycle of Intrauterine Insemination. This procedure is smooth and rarely causes any discomfort. Mild vaginal bleeding may occur during the treatment that is normal. Some patients may experience mild cramps after the treatment that goes away easily. The length of the treatment procedure is around 20-30 minutes long and is carried out in the doctor&rsquo;s clinic.</span></p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p><span style="font-size:11pt">A kidney transplant is a procedure done to replace the dysfunctional kidneys with healthy kidneys from either a living or a deceased donor. The main function that the kidneys play in our body isfiltering and removing waste, minerals and fluid no longer needed in the body through urine. If the kidneys loose their ability of filtering the waste and fluids, large amounts of these toxic substances accumulate in your body and increase your blood pressure and result in kidney failure which is the end-stage kidney disease. When the kidneys have lost about 90% of their ability to function normally, end-stage renal disease occurs. The common causes of end-stage kidney disease include Diabetes, Chronic, uncontrolled high blood pressure, Chronic glomerulonephritis &mdash; an inflammation and eventual scarring of the tiny filters within your kidneys (glomeruli) and Polycystic kidney disease. A kidney transplant or dialysis is mandatory for the people diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease. A kidney transplant is always the main option as compared with a lifetime on dialysis. As compared to dialysis, a kidney transplant can give the patient: A better quality of life, lower risk of death, fewer dietary restrictions and a lower cost of treatment. But for certain people with kidney failure, a transplant may be more risky than dialysis. These people include &ndash; people of advanced age, people with severe heart disease, patients with active or recently treated cancer, people on alcohol and drugs,&nbsp; &nbsp;people with dementia or other mental illnesses and patients with any other factor that could affect the ability to safely undergo the procedure and take the medications needed after a transplant to prevent organ rejection. Only one donated kidney is needed to replace two kidneys which makes kidney transplant a good option. A donor could be a living or deceased donor. Tests used to determine whether a donated kidney is fit for you or not include blood typing, tissue typing and crossmatch. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">A kidney transplant is a major treatment hence the patients are under general anaesthesia during the whole procedure. The whole procedure takes around two to three hours. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">Open nephrectomy is performed traditionally which involves making one 15-20 centimetre long incision at the side of the abdomen to remove the kidney. This technique is still prevalent and used by many surgeons.A kidney transplants can also be done using &ldquo;keyhole&rdquo; or laparoscopic surgical techniques. This surgery is becoming more common as time and technology is advancing. The laparoscopic technique involves a number of small incisions which are 1-3 centimetres long, through which laparoscopic instruments are inserted in order to remove the kidney. Then, a larger incision is made to take out the kidney. A Keyhole surgery may take longer to perform than the traditional open nephrectomy, but it is helpful as the recovery time in this technique is quicker as the incisions are smaller.After the kidney of the donor is removed, he/she is taken to the recovery room. From the operation, he or she would be having several tubesinserted during the operation, which may include a tube inserted into the bladder (catheter) and a drainage tube from the wound, all of which are removed a few days after the surgery. To carry a kidney transplant, number of methods is used the most common of which is a Gibson Incision which is a three stage procedure. During the first step, an incision is made in the lower abdomen, through which the donated kidney is placed in your body.The kidneys of the patient will usually be left as they are and where they are, until they cause a problem, for example an infection.Secondly, blood vessels from your lower abdomen will be attached to that of the donated kidney which provide the donated kidney with the blood supply which is needed for them to function properly. At last, the ureter of the donated kidney is connected to the bladder of the patient.</span></p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Cochlear Implant is an electronic device of a very small size that is used as a hearing aid for deaf patients or the one that has very less ability to hear. The device basically consists of an external part that has a microphone to catch the sounds in the surroundings that fits behind the ear of the patient and an internal part that is placed inside the skin of the ear surgically. The other parts are a Speech Processor that arranges and processes the sound picked by the microphone, a Transmitter that receives the signals from the Speech Processor and convert it into the electrical signals and lastly an Electrode Array that collect the impulses generated by the processor and send it to the auditory nerve regions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong><span style="color:black">Procedure</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">The placement of the cochlear implant starts with giving general anesthesia to the patient as it is placed surgically inside the patient. It starts with taking a complete medical history of the patient and checking if the implant placement is the best suitable option for the patient. A small incision behind the ear and the mastoid bone is drilled to reach to the target, which is the inner ear. Before giving an incision, the area is thoroughly sterilized and hairs are shaved from that area. After that, the implant is placed under the skin and the electrode part of the implant is placed into the inner ear portion. After the placement of the implant, certain tests are performed to check the response of the patient to the implant. Incisions are closed thereafter with disposable sutures and dressing is done on the operated area. Instructions are given to the patient about when and how to remove the dressing. The length of the procedure is very short. The implant is turned on after 4 weeks of the surgery. It takes 1.5-2 hours for the surgery to get completed. The implant may be placed in both or in only one ear. In infants and children, it is placed in both the ears. An Audiologist or an auditory based therapist guides the patient to hear best with the cochlear implant. The performance of the cochlear implant is based upon a number of factors that includes the duration for how long and at what age the patient had lost his /her hearing ability, cause of the hearing loss and most importantly the placement of the cochlear implant. The patient may get back to normal routine within a few days after the surgery and take extra care of the implant area.</span></p>\r\n',

There are mainly four types of keyhole surgeries namely as follows.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Types of Keyhole Surgeries</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Arthroscopy: It is a keyhole surgery that is used for the treatment and diagnosis of the diseases related to the knee joint. </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Video assisted laparoscopic surgery (vats): It is the name of the keyhole surgery that is performed in the lungs, oesophagus and chest regions. </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Parathyroidectomy: Removing of the parathyroid gland with the keyhole surgery is known as Parathyroidectomy. </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="font-size:11pt">Laparoscopy: Keyhole surgery that is performed for the detection and treatment of the diseases related to the abdomen and pelvic region is known as Laparoscopy.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11pt">After the careful examination of the patient&rsquo;s medical history, the surgery starts with making small incisions of the size1-1.5 inch on the target site. Depending upon the need of the procedure, that is, whether it is carried out to diagnose a particular disease or for the treatment of the disease, the number of incisions to be given is decided accordingly. For the diagnosis purpose, only one incision is given and for the treatment, multiple incisions are given. Through the incision a tube is passed into the target site. Now carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the tube to reach the target site and inflate it for better vision during the surgery. Through the incision laparoscopy which is an instrument that has a telescopic lens system connected to give the image of the affected site on the screen, instruments are passed. The correct position of the instrument into the affected site is reached with the help of the laparoscope. Once the instrument reaches the position, the procedure is carried out over there out of the target site. After the surgery, closure of the incisions with stitches is done. If the keyhole surgery is performed for the diagnosis of a disease, it will take around 30-60 minutes and if it is carried out for the treatment of a particular disease, the procedure will be longer than an hour.</span></p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Coronary Angioplasty is a treatment procedure that is used to correct the defective coronary arteries. The defective arteries get blocked and with the help of coronary angioplasty treatment the blockage or the obstruction in the blood flow to the coronary arteries is removed with the help of a balloon like device they will get inflated at the site of obstruction and press the clot or the blockage and provide way for the blood to flow properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Coronary Angioplasty is mainly of two types</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">1 Ballon Angioplasty</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">2 Stent Placements</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for The Coronary Angioplasty </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure begins with taking the medical history of the patient and asking about all the details such as any ongoing medication for some other health problem, any allergy that the patient has. Blood tests and general checkups of the patient are done to ensure if the patient is suitable for the surgery. With the help of Angiogram Temne location of the blockage in the arteries is detected. Patient is advised to fast for 6-7 hours before the surgery begins. The patient vitals are monitored and patient is linked to a heart monitor to observe the heart function throughout the surgery. The patient is injected with local anaesthesia. Small incision is made in the area where is pulse can be felt. Small sheath is inserted into the incised area of the artery to keep it open during the surgery followed by catheter Boeing inserted through this sheath to the artery. Then a flexible wire is inserted into artery via catheter. A small balloon is inserted via the wire and is inflated for 20-30 seconds. This will lead to the breakdown of the clot or any fatty material inside the artery. The inflation of the balloon is done several times to remove the blockage. The patient may experience some pain when the balloon is inflated and that goes away when the balloon is deflated. After the procedure the artery is checked if the blood is flowing properly through it properly by inserting a contrast dye and observing its flow through the artery. After that the catheter, sheath and balloon and the wire is removed. If there is any bleeding it is stopped by putting pressure over the area. The length of coronary angioplasty is around 2 hours and takes longer sometimes. The patient is kept under observation for 24 hours after the surgery and is advised to stay in the hospital. Patient is advised to rest for at least a week after the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The complications that may arise in Coronary angioplasty are injury to the artery while inserting sheath, allergy due to the contrast dye, excessive bleeding during the surgery and damage to the artery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">After the surgery blood thinning medications are advised to the patient for up to one year. Patient is advised to bring lifestyle changes that include maintaining weight, quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet and exercise regularly.

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">CABG is a highly invasive surgical procedure that is performed to improve the flow of blood to the heart. It reduces the risk of death that may occur due to coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease. It makes use of blood vessels from other parts of the body. The number of blood vessels used depends upon the severity and the number of blockages present. The blood vessels for the grafting are usually the arteries from the arm or chest region or veins from the leg region. It is an open heart surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">INDICATIONS FOR THE CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">CABG is indicated in case of coronary artery disease and due to this the patient experiences symptoms such as indigestion, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, abnormal heart rhythms and palpitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for The Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure starts with taking complete medical history of the patient followed by physical examination of the patient. Blood tests and diagnostic tests are performed to check for any abnormalities such as clot. Patient is advised not to eat or drink at least 8 hours prior to the surgery. The surgery begins with giving anaesthesia to the patient. After that breathing tube is inserted via throat and it is connected to the ventilator to provide the patient life support during the surgery. Catheter is inserted to drain the urine. The heart rate and blood pressure are monitored continuously during the surgical procedure. Then incision is given in the legs or the wrist to find the blood vessels that need to be used for the graft purpose. After finding the blood vessel,the incision is closed. Now the doctor will give an incision in the chest region to expose your heart. The heart of the patient is made to stop temporarily by putting and heart lung bypass machine is used to pump the blood from the heart to the body.Once the heart has been stopped, grafting procedure will began, by connecting the one end of the vein with the tiny opening made on the aorta and the other end is connected to the coronary artery below the blockage. The number of grafts needed may depend upon the amount of the blockage present. Once all the grafts has been put in place and once they are checked, the blood from heart lung bypass machine is sent back to heart and once the heart restarts either on its own or after giving shock, the heart lung bypass machine is removed. In some cases, heart lung bypass machine is not used and hence heart is still working during the surgery. In such cases the area around the artery to be bypassed is stabilised with the help of a special instrument. After the procedure is completed the incision are sutured and a sterile bandage is placed on the incised area. Once the patient body starts responding and breathing and heart beat is back, breathing tube is then removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The patient is kept under observation after the surgery and all the vitals are carefully monitored. The patient can drink and eat after the breathing tube and catheter are removed. Patient is advised to take proper rest and clean the operated area properly. Sutures are removed during follow up after the healing the complete. The patient should immediately consult the doctor if he or she experiences pain, swelling at the site of graft taken, has fever higher or nearly 100 degrees Celsius, severe pain at the site of the incisions and bleeding at the operated site. This surgical procedure is quit lengthy and make take up to more then3-6 hours. The patient has to stay for 7-10 days in the hospital after the surgery. The complications of the coronary artery bypass grafting include myocardial infarction, renal failure, respiratory tract infections and cerebrovascular complications.</p>\r\n',

Complete medical hosting of the patient is taken. Patient is asked about any allergy he or she have, any medication they are talking before the procedure starts. As the technique makes use of X-ray radiations, it is performed in the radiology department. The patient is made to lie down on a hollow donut like machine. Electrodes are attached to the patient&rsquo;s body. The patient is given beta blockers to slow down the heart and to monitor the heart rate and rhythmic the heart properly. The vitals signs of the patient are maintained throughout. Tosee affected arteries, a contrast dye is injected via the arm or hand of the patient by giving local anaesthesia before injecting the dye to minimise the discomfort to patient.The CT machine is operated by a technician from another room that separated by glass window form the examination room.The X-ray machine will click the images of patient from different angles. Movement of the patient is restricted to avoid distortion in the images obtained. After the procedure the patient is advised to take lots of fluid to flush out the dye that has been injected in the body.The procedure takes around one hour that includes making the patient ready for the procedure and beta blockers and dye insertion. It is non surgical technique and patient is all set to leave immediately after the procedure is completed. The diagnosis made on the basis of the abnormal test results includes any obstruction or blockage, reduced blood flow to the artery, atherosclerosis and Congenital heart disease. The advised treatment for these abnormalities includes balloon angioplasty or stunt implantation for opening the blocked arteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Pregnant ladies are advised not to go for CT Coronary angiogram as the radiation may impose serious risk.Regardless of the test results; patient is advised to exercise regularly, stop smoking, eat healthy food and adopt a healthy lifestyle and reduce stress. The risk involved in the procedure includes the radiation exposure, contrast dye may pose a problem for the diabetic and kidney disease patients as it takes longer time for them to flush out he dye from their body and they to drinks extra amount of water to flush out the dye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As this dye material contains iodine, it may cause some allergy reactions in some patients such as itching, skin rashes, difficulty in breathing and cardiac arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',

What medical conditions make someone eligible for ECMO?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The conditions vary but include severe pneumonia, severe forms of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe asthma (status asthmaticus), pulmonary hypertensive crisis, massive pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), acute coronary syndrome (heart attack), acute decompensated heart failure, severe myocarditis, and post-cardiotomy shock (shock following open heart surgery).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. Who will take care of me while I am on the ECMO?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The multidisciplinary staff including the cardiac or thoracic surgeons, perfusionists, critical care physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, etc. who have all been specially trained to care for ECMO patients will take care of you and your health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. How long can someone be on the ECMO for?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> It depends on the condition of the patient. Generally, a patient is on the ECMO for 1-2 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. How much does an ECMO cost?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The cost of the therapy depends upon the condition of the patient. At some hospitals, the ECMO therapy cost in India for the first four days is Rs.50, 000 - Rs.75,000 per day, which declines to Rs.35,000 - Rs.45,000 per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What is the most common complication for ECMO?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The most common complication is bleeding. Thromboembolism and cannula complications are rare may be less than 5 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. Do you breathe while on ECMO?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The patients are usually helped with breathing with an endotracheal tube (ET tube) placed in your mouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. Does an ECMO hurt?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Not generally. Patients connected to the ECMO are already connected to the ventilator through a breathing tube down their nose or mouth and have already received sedatives or pain medications. Even when they are connected at first, they do not feel the tubes going into their veins and arteries as they are sedated. While some medications can make you sleepy, some patients are awake so they can interact with their family and loved ones.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Gastrointestinal cancer refers to the malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. The symptoms are related to the affected organs and can also include abnormal bleeding, difficulty in swallowing and defecating, and other associated problems. Endoscopy and bioscopy are required for diagnosing the illness and identifying where it really is. Cancers of the upper digestive tract include esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, and gall bladder cancer. While colorectal and anus cancer and gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor are cancers of the lower digestive tract. Various procedures for the treatment or removal of tumors are available which include surgery, radiotherapy, and therapies using medications (immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong><u>Procedure Of Treatment </u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Esophageal Cancer-</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">Surgery-</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Esophagectomy is the most common surgery for the treatment of esophageal cancer where the doctor first detaches the esophagus from the stomach and then removes the affected part of it and then connects the healthy part of the esophagus to the stomach making it easier for the patient to swallow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; For anal cancer, local resections can be done on the tumours which are small and have not spread but if other treatments do not seem to work out, doctors may recommend abdominoperineal resection in which the anus, rectum, part of the colon, and sometimes lymph nodes are removed and a colostomy is performed by attaching the remaining colon to an opening which is surgically made in your abdomen (stoma). Also, a small bag is attached to the stoma to collect stool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; In the case of bile duct cancer, a bile duct resection can be done in which the tumour is removed by removing some or all of the bile duct it is located in. A new duct is then created by connecting it to the intestine. A partial hepatectomy may be a cure for intrahepatic bile duct cancers and more extensive extrahepatic cancers. In this, the part of the liver with the bile duct cancer is removed along with the surrounding tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Polypectomy and Local Excisions are done for colon cancer. These treatments access early-stage cancers and colon polyps through a long flexible tube that is inserted into the colon via the rectum. During the surgery, the polyps are removed from the wall of the colon. In a local excision, the cancer is removed along with a margin of the surrounding tissue. A partial or total colectomy can also be done to either remove a part of or the entire colon. In a hepatic infusion pump implantation, pumps of the size of a hockey puck are used to deliver chemotherapy directly to the metastatic colon cancers in the liver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; For liver cancer, partial hepatectomy is done for metastasized colorectal cancers and metastasized neuroendocrine tumours of the small intestine and pancreas. Liver ablation is done for tumours of less than 1.5 inches in diameter. Microwave ablation is done using heat from microwaves to kill cancer cells and radiofrequency ablation is done using high-frequency electric currents. For the people who are too weak to go through a partial hepatectomy, a liver transplant is a way. In this treatment, the whole of your liver is removed and replaced with a deceased donor&rsquo;s healthy liver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Whipple procedures(pancreatoduodenectomy) are the most common surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer which includes removing the head of the pancreas, a part of the small intestine and bile duct, the gallbladder, and the associated lymph nodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; For the small intestine, small bowel resection is the most common surgery. In this, the part of the intestine which is affected by the cancer cells is removed by the surgeon and then the 2 remaining sides of the intestine are connected to ensure proper functioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Partial and total gastrectomy are treatments involving partial or entire removal of the stomach based on cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">2. Endoscopic Therapy For Esophageal Cancer-</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A long tube called an endoscope is used to treat symptoms related to esophageal cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Endoscopy and dilation &ndash;In this procedure, the esophagus is expanded. It may have to be repeated again if the tumour grows in size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Endoscopy with stent placement- Here, endoscopy is used to place a metal mesh stent in the esophagus to expand it and keep it open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Electrocoagulation &ndash;In this treatment, cancer cells are destroyed using the heat of electric current.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Cryotherapy- In this palliative treatment an endoscope with a probe is used which freezes the tumour and helps to reduce the size of the tumour to help the patient in swallowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Photodynamic therapy &ndash; In photodynamic therapy, light-sensitive substance called a photosensitizer is given through a vein and laser is directed at the esophageal lesions using an endoscope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Laser therapy- In this, a laser is used to burn the esophageal lesions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">3. Radiation Therapy- Radiation therapy is given directly inside the body which is called internal radiation therapy. It involves inserting a radioactive wire into the area affected with cancer using an endoscope. You can expect each session to be of 10 to 30 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">4.&nbsp; Therapies Using Medications-</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Chemotherapy- It is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells. Medicines are often given intravenously (IV) or are swallowed (orally). Chemotherapy is cyclic and enough time is given to the patient&rsquo;s body to rest in between. One basic chemo could range from 5 minutes to 8 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Immunotherapy- It is a procedure for strengthening the immune system of the body to make it able to fight against cancer. Materials made inside the body or in the laboratory are used to improve the natural defense system of the body and are given either through a vein or orally. Every treatment takes around 30 to 90 minutes of time and continues for months with one dose every two to three weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull; Targeted therapy- This treatment targets proteins that control how cancer cells grow, divide and spread.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. What are the side effects of targeted therapy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Side effects of targeted therapy include diarrhea, fatigue, liver problems, mouth sores, nail changes, loss of hair color, and skin problems like a rash or dry skin. A hole can form through the wall of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large bowel, rectum, or gallbladder, very rarely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. What is metastatic cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Metastatic cancer is cancer that originates from one part of the body and spreads to other parts of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. What is a polyp?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> A polyp is a mushroom-like growth that forms due to the abnormal growth and division of the cells lining the colon. They become cancerous over time spreading to other parts of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What are the causes of liver cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Chronic infection, diabetes, excessive consumption of alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cirrhosis are some causes of liver cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What is the cost of gastrointestinal surgery in India?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Gastrointestinal surgery can cost 2.5 lakhs to 6 lakhs in India.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Liposuction is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of excessive fat of the body by suction with the help of specialized surgical equipments.The sites of fat removal are usually the abdomen, hips, thighs, neck, arms and buttocks. Liposuction also helps to contour the site involved in the fat removal that means, it gives a proper shape to these areas. Others name for this treatment are Lipoplasty and body contouring. This is not an overall solution to complete weight loss. Liposuction is mainly done for the patients who have excessive fat at specific body locations and otherwise have a normal body weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">These are the different types of technologies that are applied in the liposuction surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">1) Tumescent liposuction: It is the common type among all. It involves injecting a sterile solution that helps in the fat removal followed by local anesthesia namely lidocaine that help to relieve pain and at last drug named epinephrine is added to constrict the blood vessels in the area where the surgery is to be performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">2) Ultrasound-assisted liposuction: In this type of liposuction insertion of metal rod is done in the skin that will emit ultrasonic energy and helps to burst the fat cell walls and ultimately the fat molecules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">3) Laser assisted liposuction: It involves removing the fat by breaking it with the help of a high intensity laser light</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">4) Power assisted liposuction: This technique involves fat removal with rapid back and forth motion of the cannula. This technique is not much painful and is more precise for the fat removal. This is used in case of patient with a history of prior liposuction treatment</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The surgery involves insertion of the hollow tube known as cannula through the small incision that is made into the skin. The inserted cannula removes the excessive fat that is located as pockets of fats, from the various body parts. .The procedure is usually not highly invasive. During the procedure regional or local anesthesia is injected to the part from the fat has to be removed. General anesthesia may also be required in some cases to make the patient relaxed and calm. Heart rate, blood oxygen level and blood pressure of the patient are monitored throughout the treatment procedure. The surgery starts with marking the areas where the procedure has to be performed.Pictures are taken to show the patient before and after treatment differences and the desired results achieved. Sedatives and antibiotics are prescribed by the surgeon for infection and pain control. Patient is advised not to wear tight fitting garments as the incision are left open by the doctor and it may cause pain to the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Complications:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Anesthesia related risk may arise followed by infection, swelling, accumulation of fluid at the site of the surgery, poor healing of the wound. Further, there may be bleeding under the skin and pigmentation of the treated areas of the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Duration:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The surgery is carried for several hours and the time involved varies with the site of the surgery. Usually the patient under general anesthesia will wake up after sometime. The patient is monitored by the team of doctors for few hours after the surgery so that the patient does not get dehydrated and go to the state of shock. Therefore it is usually advisable to stay overnight to avoid any sudden complication. The patient is advised to wait for few days before resuming their normal lifestyle and work.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_faqs:
      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. How much does it cost a person to get the liposuction surgery done?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The cost of the treatment depends upon the number of sites involved in the surgery. If only single site is involved then the cost will be less compared to the multiple sites involved for fat removal. Average cost range between Rs.50, 000 to Rs 1, 00,000 and will increase further depending on the number of areas included in the treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. For how long does the patient have to stay in the hospital after the treatment?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The procedure is completed within hours. But usually the patient is recommended to stay for at least one night at the hospital under the observation of the doctors. It usually takes around 5-7 days for the patient to completely cure and return to normal work life and routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3.&nbsp; Is the liposuction treatment painful?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The treatment is painless while it is performed as the patient is under anesthesia. But yes, the patient may experience some after the effect of anesthesia wears off. For this purpose the doctor prescribe antibiotics and painkillers to the patient for time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4.&nbsp; For how long the results of the liposuction stay after the surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Liposuction treatment results are permanent and the fat does not return back. This is followed by weight maintained by the patient after the surgery because fat distribution changes as the person gains weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5.&nbsp; Is liposuction treatment suitable for everyone?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Persons with heart diseases, diabetes and weak immunity should avoid this treatment. Anyone above 18 years of age and with good health is all set to go for the treatment.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">A liver transplant or hepatic transplant is done to replace a failed liver with a part of or all of the liver of either a deceased or a living donor. When the cells of the liver are destroyed, much of its function is lost. It is able to flourish again except for the cases in which the cells are majorly destroyed. Patients with end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure can avail this treatment keeping in mind the major life modifications after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tests including an electrocardiogram, blood tests and a chest X-ray will be taken beforehand. The operation is performed through a large incision in the upper abdomen. During the operation, all ligamentous attachments like the bile duct, hepatic vein, hepatic artery and the portal vein are separated from the diseased liver. The blood in the donor&rsquo;s liver is replaced by an ice-cold organ storing solution like HTK or UW (Viaspan) up to the time of the implantation of the allograft liver while the blood entering the patient&rsquo;s liver is blocked or sent back through another tube into his body. The healthy liver is then attached by the surgeon to the bile duct and other attachments and blood flow is resumed. Several tubes are placed in the in the body to aid the body in certain functions during the procedure and for a few days after the operation as well. Liver transplantation procedures take approximately 4 to 14 hours and the average hospital stay is two to three weeks. Depending on the complications and other possibilities, one needs to be prepared for lesser or more time. During the recovery period, you will have regular blood testing and will be given certain immunosuppressive drugs like corticosteroids plus a calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin to prevent rejection, initially through the vein and later by mouth.Your diet will first begin with clear liquids, slowly progressing towards solid foods as the liver starts to function. Before the discharge, the patient learns the signs of infection and rejection and when to call a doctor. Following the doctor recommended post-transplantation plan, the patient can expect a good outcome.</p>\r\n',

Sometimes, the normal instruction cycles of our body can be altered due to the mutation of the DNA present in our body or a change in its genetic code. As a result, there is an abnormal growth in the cells leading to a tumour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">People with conditions like hepatitis B or C, alcohol users and people with cirrhosis are at an increased risk of getting affected with liver cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The types of liver cancer include primary and secondary liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of primary liver cancer which begins in cells known as hepatocytes. Secondary liver cancer is cancer that starts from a different location and moves to the liver. It is also called metastatic liver cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Early-stage liver cancer can be treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, ablation or catheter-directed therapy. However, people with severe liver tumour must go for a transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Liver cancer may be treated with surgery, locoregional therapy, different kinds of drug therapies or even a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">SURGICAL TREATMENTS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Partial Hepatectomy - Partial Hepatectomy or liver resection is performed under general anaesthesia using minimally invasive techniques. Incisions are made on your right abdomen and needle-like ports are inserted through these cuts to guide the surgical tools without harming the surrounding area. A portion of the liver is cauterized to seal the blood vessels and prevent internal bleeding. Then, using the laparoscope, layers of the liver are cut one by one until the cancerous portion is removed. This treatment is only available for people with a liver in good condition and a single tumour that has not yet grown into the blood vessels. The treatment can take anywhere between two to four hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Total Hepatectomy and liver transplant&ndash;In total Hepatectomy, the whole liver is replaced with a healthy liver of a donor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Most treatments take 2-4 hours of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">OTHER TREATMENTS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Ablation therapy- Cryoablation, microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation and ethanol ablation are used to treat tumours without removing them. This is done by destroying them directly. The entire procedure takes around 1 to 3 hours of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy - This is a therapy in which drugs are used to destroy cancer cells. It is systemic ( the pills and injections travel inside the whole body). As the chemo is given in cycles it can take two to three weeks of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Targeted therapy &ndash;Here, drugs are used to zero in on the cancer tissues or cells. It is different from chemotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Immunotherapy &ndash;In this therapy, drugs are given to direct the immune system to kill the cancer cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Loco-regional therapy&ndash; In this, beads is injected into the blood vessels which feed the tumor (Radio mobilization). The beads deliver radiation therapy directly into the tumor when they become trapped in the small blood vessels of the tumor. A different version of this type of therapy is called chemoembolization of the hepatic artery. The chemotherapy drug is mixed with the beads in order to block the artery.</p>\r\n',

These include the testing of the donor&rsquo;s lung(s), on the approval of which the recipient is connected to an IV line and various monitoring equipment including pulse oximetry. General anaesthesia is given to the patient and a machine which would breathe for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In single-lung transplantation, the lung with a worsened pulmonary function is chosen to be replaced and if both of the lungs function equally, the right lung is preferred to the left to avoid manoeuvring around the heart. Either an incision from under the shoulder blade around the chest ending near the sternum, or an incision under the breastbone is made. The lung is collapsed, the blood vessels of the lung are tied off and&nbsp; and it is removed at the bronchial tube. After that, the donor&rsquo;s lung is reattached to the blood vessels and the lung is reinflated. A bronchoscopy is then performed to ensure the clearance of the remaining blood and mucus in the lung. The surgeons then close the incision after their satisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In the case of sequential double lung transplant, an incision is made from the patient&#39;s under armpit, around to the sternum, and then back towards the other armpit; which is termed as a clamshell incision. The weakest functioning lung is collapsed, the blood vessels tied off and cut at the corresponding bronchi. The healthy lung is then placed and the blood vessels are reattached. Bronchoscopy is performed to ensure that the lung is satisfactory. After the surgeons are assured of the first lung, the second lung is replaced with the same procedure. During 10 to 20 percent of double-lung transplants, the patient&rsquo;s body is attached to a heart-lung machine which pumps blood and provides for the oxygen of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Usually, it takes around one hour for the pre-operative preparation and four to eight hours for a single-lung transplant. Whereas double-lung transplantation takes around six to twelve hours to complete.A history of prior chest operations could complicate the procedure and lead to requirement of additional time.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Left ventricular assist device is a mechanical that aids to pumps the blood from the ventricles of the heart to the rest of the body when the heart is not able to pump enough blood. It is implanted surgically. It doesn&rsquo;t replace the heart of the patient, rather it pumps along with</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Patient&rsquo;s own heart. An open heart surgery is performed to place the LVAD. There are two ways in which LVADS can be used in the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Bridge to transplant (BTT)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Left ventricular assist device can be used as bridge to transplant in the patient&rsquo;s who are advised for the Heart transplant surgery but are in the waiting list to find a suitable donor. For the time being, while the donor is being searched, the patient is implanted with LVAD to support their health and to prevent the further deterioration of the heart function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Destination Therapy </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">LVAD is used as a destination therapy in the patient&rsquo;s who are not suitable candidates for the Heart transplant and are suffering from heart failure. It is the last treatment option for these patients when all other procedure has failed or are not appropriate for the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Left Ventricular Assist Device </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before the procedure begins, it is evaluated whether the patient is an appropriate candidate to undergo LVAD replacement. It is done by performing tests such as ECG, X-ray, Blood-work, metabolic stress test and Electrocardiogram. Type of LVAD used is Heart mate 3 LVAD and Heart-wave LVAD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure starts with giving general anaesthesia to the patient. This is followed by making an incision in the chest region and then reaching the heart. During the surgery as the Heart is made to stop, therefore lung heart bypass machine is used to pump the oxygen rich blood throughout the body. Ventilator is used to maintain the breathing during the implantation of LVAD. Then the LVAD is implanted into the apex of the heart.&nbsp; After the placement of the LVAD the incision is closed. The procedure takes around 4-6 hours long. The recovery period varies among each patient depending upon the health of the patient. The patient is advised to follow up regularly after the surgery that is after every week and then followed by once in the month. The patient is kept under observation for about 14-21 days after the surgery. The benefits of the LVAD Implantation include better quality of life, fewer heart failure symptoms and patient can live better life. Various risks involved in the LVAD implantation includes bleeding from the incision site, kidney injury, Right heart failure, formation of blood clot and stroke.</p>\r\n',

    specilization_id: "25",
    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">This surgery is a procedure to repair torn knee cartilage. A meniscus tear is a common knee injury caused by forceful twisting or rotation of the knee, which can stop your knee from functioning right. Some symptoms of the meniscus tear include swelling and pain in the knee, a popping sensation during the injury, difficulty in bending and straightening the leg and a tendency for you knee getting locked up. If the treatments like physical therapy, rest, pain relievers and application of ice on the surface do not work for you, you might need a meniscus repair surgery which will be recommended by your doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for treatment </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Firstly, the knee is examined and the anaesthetic administered. On the upper thigh, a tourniquet is placed and the thigh is secured to a table with a limb holder which is padded. A diagnostic arthroscopy is performed on the cleaned knee and lower leg. It is the examination of the joint from the inside with a camera hooked to viewing screens. The instruments (5mm in diameter) are inserted through 3-4 incisions of 1mm diameter around the knee. One of which is for sterile saline inflow, for improving visualisation within the joint. The meniscus tear is then identified and probed with a small metal hook. The decision of repairing or removing the damaged tissue is made on the basis of the location, stability, size, pattern and the tissue quality of the meniscus tear. The opposite edges of the tear are made to enhance healing with the help of a small rasp or motorised shaver. If there is any doubtfulness about the blood supply to the tear, methods like placing a blood clot between the parts of the tear to create small vascular access channels in the peripheral rim of meniscus, or making the joint lining bleed, are adopted. With one or more devices including; suture, an absorbable tack, or a meniscus repair device, the meniscus is secured back in place. The surgery usually takes 15-45 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It is an outpatient surgery and so the patient is allowed to go home after a stay of one to two hours in the recovery room.</p>\r\n',

How much does a meniscus repair surgery cost?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The cost ranges from anywhere between Rs 70,000 to Rs 1 lakhs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. What can I do to prevent a meniscus tear?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Meniscus tear is hard to prevent but some precautions may help in reducing the risk for the same. The precautions include exercising to keep your thigh muscles strong, warming up before starting with heavy exercises or activities, giving your body regular breaks to rest between workouts as fatigued muscles can lead to a risk of injury. You must maintain flexibility and see that your shoes are a good fit. Also, you must not abruptly increase the intensity of your workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. How soon after my surgery can I return to my regular activities?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Most patients are able to resume to daily activities after 4-6 weeks of surgery. A full recovery from a meniscus surgery can take anywhere from six week to three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. Can a meniscus tear lead to me needing a knee replacement later?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The risk for a later knee replacement for youngsters is relatively small as compared to the elderly with big tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What can you not do after meniscus surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> After the surgery you cannot do twisting, pivoting, squatting, deep knee bends or impact activities for at least four months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. What can I do for the pain after a meniscus surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> For most of the patients, the pain after an arthroscopic surgery is minimal which can further be handled through medications like ibuprofen and naproxen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7.

After the consent is signed, the patient&rsquo;s medical history is taken. Blood tests are performed to check the clotting time. Detailed information of the ongoing medication is provided to the surgeon before the surgery. One of the most important information is the history of bleeding disorder and related medication if any should be provided to the doctor. Sedation is usually given to the patient to make the patient calm and for painless procedure during the surgery. The bladder of the patient is made empty prior to the surgery and the patient is advised to fast before the surgery. Electrocardiogram (ECG) will continuously monitor the heart activity. The vitals are checked repeatedly during the surgery. An incision is made at the target site where the pacemaker needs to be inserted. A plastic tube is inserted in the blood vessel and then into the heart through which the lead of the pacemaker will be inserted into the heart. The number of pacemaker wires inserted depends upon the type of pacemaker selected for the surgery. Now it&#39;s time for the pacemaker generator to be placed at the target site. Incisions are suture and dressing is placed over the site. The patientis put on complete bed rest and is under observation in the intensive care unit. Once the patient&rsquo;s vitals are normal and breathing is normal they are ready to be shifted to the room. Patient may be discharged after a day or two after the surgery when the observation period is over and the patient has responded well. It is advised to take the patient to not to drive back home by themselves after the surgery. Check up is done after every 3 months to check the working of the pacemaker.Within a week or two the patient is ready to return back to the normal daily routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The risks involved in the surgery are infection, bleeding at the site of pacemaker placement, and shifting in the position of the pacemaker that leads to cardiac perforation. Duration of Pacemaker implantation is 2-5 hours. There are some basic precautions that need to be followed after the surgery. Patient with pacemaker implanted in them is advised not to place the cell phone close to the site of pacemaker. Medical procedures such as CT scan, MRI could interfere in the pace maker working.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Childhood cancer or paediatric cancer is the cancer of children from birth to the age of 18 to 19. Mostly, there is no known cause childhood cancer. Paediatric cancers behave different from adult cancers even if they begin from the same part of the body. Cancer in children is uncommon which makes it difficult for surgeons and doctors to diagnose them without being certain. Therefore more than 60% of children with cancer are treated as part of clinical trials. The most common forms of cancer in children are leukaemias, bone cancer, retinoblastoma, brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumours and lymphomas. Most cancers begin when healthy cells begin to grow uncontrollably. They can either be cancerous or benign. A benign tumour grows but does not spread to other parts of the body whereas; a cancerous tumour grows and spreads to other parts of the body. The options available for treatment depend upon different factors which include the stage and type of cancer, the side effects possible, preferences of the patient and their overall health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure For Treatment </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery-<u> </u>A surgery is a treatment for the removal of cancerous or non-cancerous tumour and some of its healthy surrounding area. It is performed by a surgical oncologist. Many children would need a surgery at some point during their treatment. In the surgery, the tumour is removed by the surgeon, along with the tissue surrounding the tumour which creates a negative margin, and leaves no sign of tumour behind. A tumour removal surgery can usually take 2-6 hours of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Therapies using medications-<u> </u>The use of medications for the treatment of cancer is called systemic therapy. It destroys cancer cells throughout the body. Systemic therapy is either given intravenously using a tube placed in your vein or orally through the mouth in the form of pills. The types of systemic therapy include:-</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy- This treatment is done using drugs to destroy cancer cells by keeping the cells from growing, dividing and making more cells. The drugs are given using and IV tube or orally depending upon the type and stage of the cancer. Chemotherapy is given in cycles over a set period of time.</li>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:justify">Immunotherapy- Also called biologic therapy; immunotherapy is designed to work on and improve the natural defence system of the patient&rsquo;s body. It uses materials developed by the body or in laboratory to either improve or restore the immune system of the body. Cancer vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and interferon&rsquo;s are examples of immunotherapy. Each treatment takes about 30 to 90 minutes and continues till months where you will be given a dose every two to three weeks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiation therapy<u>-</u> Doctors often make an effort to minimise or avoid the usage of radiation therapy for the treatment of children as radiation can risk the other organs as well. In external beam radiation, radiation is given from outside the body, and in internal radiation therapy, implants are used to give radiation internally. A radiation therapy is scheduled at a particular number of treatments over a period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Bone marrow transplantation/ stem cell transplantation-<u> &nbsp;</u>&nbsp;In this transplant (also known as stem cell transplant), bone marrow containing cancer is replaced with specialised cells (also called hematopoietic stem cells) which develop into a healthy bone marrow later. Hematopoietic stem cells are cells found in the bone marrow as well as the bloodstream. Depending upon the source of replacement stem cells, hematopoietic stem cell transplant is of two types &ndash;allergenic (called ALLO) and autonomous (called AUTO). When donated cells are used it is ALLO and when the cells of the patient are used it is called an AUTO hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in both of which the goal is the destruction of all cancer cells in the bone marrow, blood and other parts of the body using chemotherapy or radiation therapy followed by replacement of the blood stem cells to create a healthy bone marrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. What is remission and recurrence of the cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Remission is when the cancer has no symptoms or does not show in any of the tests. But it is temporary and this uncertainty cause&rsquo;s worry among most patients. The return of cancer after the original disease and its treatment is called recurrence of the cancer. It may be back in the same region (called a local recurrence), in a nearby region (called regional recurrence) or in another place in the body (called distant recurrence). When this happens you will go through a series of tests to identify the type of cancer you have and you can choose the related treatment. Palliative therapy is a must in this case scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. What is the survival rate for paediatric cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Since the mid 1970s, there has been acceleration in the 5 years survival rate from 58% to 85% because of major implementations in the healthcare facilities and treatment advances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. How can you reduce the risk of childhood cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> You must avoid the use of tobacco and alcohol consumption as well. Also, by keeping children from second hand smoke helps. Avoiding exposure to traffic related air pollution and other harmful chemicals which can because cancer reduces the risk of paediatric cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What are the early signs of cancer in children?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Some early symptoms include easy bruising or bleeding, limping, unexplained paleness and loss of energy, frequent headaches with often vomiting, unexplained fever or illness that does not go away, sudden eye or vision changes,&nbsp; an ongoing pain in one region of the body and sudden unexplained weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. Can childhood cancer be cured?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>It is a leading cause of death in children and adolescents. The survival rate and diagnosis depends upon the country one is living in. in high-income countries, more than 80% of children with cancer are cured, but in many LMICs less than 30% are cured.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. How much does the treatment cost?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The average cost of the treatment for paediatric cancer in India is around 5 lakh.</p>\r\n',

It is mostly used in case of superficial palpable masses such as in case of breast cancer detection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">CATHETER DRAINAGES SYSTEM: Catheter drainage system makes catheter to drain out the fluid (urine) from the bladder into a drainage bag in case of patients who have undergone a major surgery or are suffering from a condition that makes it difficult for them to urinate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Pre-Cutaneous Needle Biopsies</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure starts with selecting the appropriate imaging technique such for the biopsy according to the site where it has to be performed. To scan or find the site of biopsy, X-ray or CT scan is performed. The patient is given sedative via intravenous route only if required. The site of biopsy is cleaned and local anaesthesia is given on the site. The biopsy needle will be guided through the skin to the abnormal tissue with the help of imaging technique. Patient is advised to remain still or hold the breath for few seconds while biopsy sample is taken. To obtain enough tissue samples, it is repeated 2-3 times. It takes around 30-60 minutes for the procedure to get completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">FNAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">FNAC is mainly performed by either aspiration or without aspiration. In case of FNAC with aspiration the procedure starts with cleaning the site with spirit swab. Needle is introduced into the affected area of the swelling and the needle is moved to and fro to collect the fluid from the site. The Collected aspirated material is put on the slide and smear is made that is observed under the microscope. The length of procedure is very short and takes around 10 minutes to complete</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">CATHETER DRAINAGES</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The size of the catheter drainage system varies according to the age of the patient. The procedure for urinary catheter drainage insertion starts with cleaning the genital areas. Proper hygiene of the hands of the surgeon is must to perform the procedure. Apply sterile drape or towel over the area. Separate the labia with one hand and with the hand expose the urethral opening. Clean the labia area. Now insert the catheter by asking the female patient to expose the urethral meatus. Catheter is advance to 7.5cm until the urine starts to flow from the catheter. Additional 5cm advancement of the Catheter is done. In case of male patient, penis are held up perpendicular and pulled up slightly. Catheter is inserted into the urethral meatus upto 22.5cm until the urine starts flowing into the catheter. Now the urine catheter is kept in sterile tray and urine sample is collected. Balloon is inflated to indwell the Catheter according to the size of the Catheter. Now after inflation of balloon gently pull the catheter until resistance is felt and advance it again. Now the urinary bag is connected to the catheter using a sterile technique. The catheter is secured to inner thigh in females and in upper thighs or abdomen in case of females. Urinary catheter is removed when it is no longer needed and it is made sure that the normal bladder function has returned.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition of an enlarged prostate that causes moderate to severe urinary symptoms including prolonged and frequent urination, difficulty in starting urination, and a feeling of filled bladder even after urinating. If medical treatment fails to be effective for BPH, prostate laser surgery can help to improve urinary flow in most men. The results of this treatment are often long lasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before the surgery, the patient will be given general or spinal anaesthesia. During the surgery, the doctor inserts a scope through the tip of the penis into a tube that carries urine from your bladder (urethra). The urethra is surrounded by the prostate. A laser is then passed through the scope which delivers energy in order to either shrink or destroy the excess tissue which is blocking the urethra and preventing urine flow. Laser surgery removes excess prostate tissue by ablation (melting away extra tissue) or by enucleating (cutting away extra prostate tissue).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">There are different types of Prostate laser surgery, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">1. Photo-selective vaporization of the prostate (PVP)&ndash;In this minimally invasive surgery, a tube with an imaging system (also called a cystoscope) is inserted into the penis and a laser is used to melt away extra prostate tissue to enlarge the urinary channel.A650-micro-metre laser fibre with a high power of 180-watt and wavelength of 532 nm is used during the procedure. With a reflecting angle of 70 degrees, the tissue is vaporized to the prostatic capsule. For people with blood clotting issues or problems, this can be the option as in this procedure there is comparatively less blood loss due to no scraping or cutting of tissues by the doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">2. Holmium laser ablation of the prostate (HoLAP) &ndash; It is performed for relatively smaller prostate glands, ideally below 60 grams. This procedure is similar to PVP except for the laser that is used to melt (vaporize) the excess tissue. Recently reported results show that this procedure produces good results and is durable for up to 7 years (Gilling et al, 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">3. Holmium laser enucleating of the prostate (HoLEP)&ndash;Developed in the 1990s and praised for its effectiveness and relatable less cost, in this surgery, the laser is used to cut the extra tissue blocking the urethra. A morcellator is also used to chop the prostate into several pieces which makes it easier to remove. For men with severely enlarged prostates can be the perfect option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Different factors like the size of the prostate, the health of the patient and the equipment available decide the type of surgery that the doctor will perform. The procedure takes around 30 minutes to 2 hours of time.</p>\r\n',

The patient is also safe from cardiac side effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. How much does a prostate laser surgery cost?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The average cost of prostate laser surgery in India is Rs. 1,45,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. What will it be like after laser prostate surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Once you have healed, your urinary flow will be stronger, easier to start and you will empty well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What are the side effects of prostate laser surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Reaction to anaesthesia, bleeding, infection of the surgical site, damage to organs and blood clots are possible side effects after a prostate laser surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What happens before the surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The patient is given either general or spinal anaesthesia. The patient will be fully unconscious in the case of general anaesthesia and conscious if spinal anaesthesia is given. The type of anaesthesia is however determined by the doctor based on the size of the prostate and other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. How painful is prostate removal surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> You can expect a bit of pain and soreness after the procedure. You will be given intravenous pain medications at first and will be prescribed medicines for pain by the doctor when you go back home. Also, you will have a urinary catheter in place for around a week which you will possibly find uncomfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. What should you not drink after the prostate surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Abstinence from alcohol is recommended after a prostate surgery for alcohol irritates the bladder and can cause other problems.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Septoplasty is a surgical procedure that is performed inside the nasal cavity to correct the defect of septum that has moved to one side of the nose hence providing a better airway. It is one of the types of nasal surgery that is performed in cases where the patient experiences obstruction in breathing, very often bleeding from the nose, sinus infection and headache that occurs due to the disoriented septum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Septoplasty Procedure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The surgical procedure is performed under general anaesthesia to diminish the effect of pain the patient has to tolerate. For the record purpose, the doctor will click the picture of your nose before the surgery to show the changes and result of the treatment to the patient. To start with the surgery, an incision is made on the nose to reach the septum. After the septum is located, the mucus membrane covering the septum is lifted up. After that, the deviated septum is brought back to the correct position by removing the bone or the cartilage that comes in between. After the septum is brought back to the desired location, the protective covering of the septum that is the mucus membrane is positioned over the septum. The incised area is sutured at last. To stop the bleeding during the surgery, dressing is given in the nose. The duration of the procedure is around 2 hours. The patient can be discharged on the same day of the surgery after keeping the patient under observation for sometime after the surgery. There are some basic precautionary measures that the patient is advised to follow after the surgery. These include keeping the head elevated while the patient is sleeping to prevent chances of bleeding, not to blow nose for many weeks as it causes delayed healing and to avoid hectic activities that may lead to bleeding. The patient can resume the routine lifestyle by following the given precautions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The complete healing of the nasal septum is a slow and gradual process that takes place in almost 6 months and may continue up to a year. Final results of the surgery are not completely visible until one year. There may be some complications that can arise after the surgery which include excessive bleeding after or during the surgery, decrease in the sense of smell after the surgery, there may be nasal obstruction, haematoma, and septal perforation experienced by the patient If the desired results are not achieved, additional surgery may be indicated.</p>\r\n',

These are the types of systemic therapies:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chemotherapy- Chemotherapy is one of the most common forms of treatment for cancer and involves the use of drugs to defeat and kill cancer cells in the body. You may receive chemo through your mouth (orally) or through an intravenous tube called an IV. It is given through a needle inserted through a vein or in the form of pills. The treatment is given in cycles, with sufficient time to rest in between. A basic chemo regimen may be given for 5 minimally and could last up to 8 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immunotherapy-It is a procedure for strengthening the immune system of the body to make it able to fight against cancer. Materials made inside the body or in the laboratory are used to improve the natural defense system of the body and are given either through a vein or orally. Every treatment takes around 30 to 90 minutes of time and continues for months with one dose every two to three weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiation therapy-In radiation therapy, radiation is given externally (external beam radiation therapy) by a machine directed at the required place, or internally through implants that release radiation once implanted (internal radiation or brachytherapy). These radioactive implants may be placed temporarily or permanently.&nbsp; External radiation therapy requires regular sessions generally five times a week for a period of about 5 to 8 weeks. The surgeon makes sure you are positioned well and leaves you in the room for the treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Prostatectomy-Prostatectomy is a treatment for the removal of a part of or all of the prostate gland to treat prostate cancer. You will be given anesthesia and an antibiotic before the surgery to prevent pain and infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy- The surgeon sits at a console at a short distance from you and operates the movement of the surgical instruments using two hand and finger control devices. On the console, the surgeon gets access to a magnified, 3D view of the surgical area which further enables the surgeon to work more precisely as opposed to the case of traditional laparoscopic surgery. This treatment provides precise incisions, which makes it possible for faster recovery in many men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open radical prostatectomy- An incision is made in your lower abdomen from below your navel to just above your pubic bone and the prostate gland is carefully dissected from the surrounding vessels and and nerves. The nearby tissue is also removed and the incision then closed with sutures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple prostatectomy- In the beginning,&nbsp; along, flexible viewing scope called cystoscope is inserted through the tip pf the penis to check the inside of the urethra, bladder and prostate area. Once the prostate is removed, one or two temporary drain tubes may be inserted through the punctures in your skin near the surgical site. One tube goes into your bladder, one into the area where the prostate was removed.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Tympanoplasty is a minor surgical procedure performed in the earto corrects the holeor perforation in the tympanic membrane of the ear by reconstructing itwith the placement of a graft and thus restoring hearing and the middle ear function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Indications for Tympanoplasty</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tympanoplasty is performedin case of</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">1. Congenital Deafness</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">2. Middle Ear Infection</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">3. Traumatic injury to the ear</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The symptoms of the hole in the eardrum are mainly severe pain in the ear, bleeding from the heart and complete loss of hearing ability. The ear is diagnosed with the help of otoscope. There are basically two types of ear perforations, minor and major. Minor ear perforation do not require any kind of surgical approach and can be treated by using ear drops and antibiotics. Minor perforations usually heal within a week. Ifit doesn&rsquo;t heal within a week, it means it&rsquo;s a major ear perforation and need to be treated surgically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure Of Tympanoplasty Surgery </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure starts with taking medical history of the patient and confirming about any allergy they have. Before the surgery begins, the patient is given a dose of general anaesthesia and in some cases local anesthesia.There are basically 5 types of tympanoplasty surgeries</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">1. Lateral Tympanoplasty</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">It is performed in cases with large hole in the eardrum. In this type of the surgery an incision is given behind the ear to widen the ear canal and have proper view of the operating site. The defective or torn out eardrum along with some original eardrum is removed. New eardrum is created using a graft. The skin for the graft is taken from behind the ear. The duration of this surgery is around 2.5 hours long. This is the treatment of choice where other surgeries were not successful and the defect was left untreated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">2. Medial Tympanoplasty</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Medial Tympanoplasty is performed under general or local anaesthesia. Procedure starts with making an incision behind the ear and reaching the ear canal. The damaged eardrum remnant is taken out and a graft is placed in the eardrum.The procedure takes around 60 minutes to get completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">3. Patch Tympanoplasty</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This is less painful procedure compared to the others. In this the edges of the perforation in the ears are treated with an acid and patch of paper is placed at the perforation. The procedure is completed within minutes. Patient is advised not to put water into the ear and keep it dry for better recovery. Heavy workout is also prohibited. The patient recalled after a month to check the healing of the perforation in the ear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">4. Fat Tympanoplasty</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure involves removal of fat from the eardrum by freezing the eardrum. It is a minor surgical procedure. The removed fat is placed in the hole or the perforation of the ear and then operated site is packed by giving stitches. The duration of this is around 15-20 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tympanoplasty is performed in cases of large hole or perforation in the eardrum, bad ear infection, abnormal functioning of the Eustachian tube or traumatic injury to the ear.The possible risks that could arise while performing the surgery are loss of hearing sensation, trauma to the facial nerve, trauma to the bones in the eardrum while performing the surgery and vertigo. After the surgery, the patient is Aditi keep the ear dry. Sneezing if done should be done through open mouth to prevent any pressure on the ear, blowing of the nose is prohibited and patient is instructed to take the mucusthrough the neck instead of blowing it out via nose and stitches are kept dry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Technology Used in Tympanoplasty: Microscope and Otology instrument tray is used in Tympanoplasty. If the surgery is performed with an endoscope, high resolution camera, a monitor and a light source is required.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Valvular heart disease is a defect in the any of the four valves of the heart. In this case the diseased valves are not able to close or open properly during the heartbeat. The causes of the&nbsp; valvular heart disease are Rheumatic disease, ii buy be Tu tbtEndocarditis, Congenital Heart valve disease, Heart failure, Atherosclerosis, Aortic aneurism, High blood pressure and Heart attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Types Of Valvular Heart Diseases</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Valvular stenosis</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Valvular regurgitation</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Aortic regurgitation</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tricuspid stenosis</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tricuspid regurgitation</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Pulmonary stenosis</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Pulmonary regurgitation</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Valvular Heart Disease Treatment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure starts with performing tests such as Echocardiogram that detect any damage in the heart muscles ,Cardiac catheterisation that determines the extent upto which the valve has damaged,X-ray that helps to detect enlargement areas in the heart. These tests help us to see the functioning of the valves of the heart and detect any abnormalities in them. The medication used for the treatment of the valvular heart disease includes Diuretics, Antiarrythmics, Vasodilators, Aceinhibitors, Beta blockers, and Anticoagulants. The valvular heart disease treatment plan includes Heart valve replacement surgery and heart valve repair. The heart valve replacement surgeries include Biological valve which is made up of cow tissue, pig tissue or human tissue, Homograft valve which is take up from the human donor that is dead, Ross procedure which is a very complex procedure and involves changing the position of the pulmonary valve at the place of aortic valve &nbsp;followed by placement of a homograft,Mechanical&nbsp; valves which are made up of carbon or metal and are quite long durable . The surgical approach or technique is of two type&rsquo;s namely traditional surgical approach and minimally invasive surgical approach. The traditional surgical procedure starts with giving an incision of 6-8 inches in the chest region via breastbone. It is done under general anaesthesia. After giving the incision the patient heart is reached and the arteries are examined. The minimal surgical approach is performed under general anaesthesia and smaller incisions are given as compared to the traditional approach</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair Procedure</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In this procedure, the patient is given anaesthesia to minimise the discomfort and pain during the surgery. The surgeon will give an incision in the chest region. A catheter is inserted in the region of the incision that will help in the placement of the MitraClip on the valve leaflet. This procedure is usually performed in the patient&rsquo;s who are unfit for the open heart surgical procedure for the valve repair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Transcatheter Aortic Valve Repair</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In this procedure, diseased valve of the heart is replaced with biological valve with the help of a catheter.

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Founded in 1995, the Da Vinci Xi robotic surgical system is manufactured by the company Intuitive Surgical and uses a minimally invasive surgical approach. The system translates exquisitely accurate hand movements of the surgeons at the console in real time and bends and rotates while performing the procedure. The tiny human-like hands move with a greater range of motion. The system is used increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynaecologic surgical procedures. This system can also be used by specialty surgeons for urologic, general laparoscopic, gynaecologic, thoracic and some types of heart surgery. It is also used for prostatectomies. It was used most commonly for hysterectomies and prostate removals in 2012 in around 2,00,000 surgeries around the world. Surgeons perform this robotic assisted surgery in order to extend the capabilities of their hands and eyes. Also, the robotic surgery has allowed laparoscopic na&iuml;ve surgeons to progress to minimally invasive surgery without extensive laparoscopy training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">With the help of the surgeon console, the surgeon guides the Da Vinci machine, which is just an advanced set of instruments used to perform robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgeries. The patient-side cart is where the patient is seated in a semi or fully conscious state. The Da Vinci machine translates the movements of the surgeon&rsquo;s hands in real time and switches between different tools as well. &nbsp;The tiny wristed instruments move like a human hand, but at a greater motion. This system also provides greatly magnified, 3D high definition views of the anatomy, which the surgeon views and operates upon. The electronic cart contains the supporting hardware and software components such as suction/irrigation pumps, electrical surgical unit, insufflate, and a light source for the endoscope. The endowrist instruments are designed to work at faster degrees of motion than the human hand. Every instrument has a different task including cutting, suturing, clamping, coagulating and manipulating tissue. The size of the instrument makes it possible for the surgeons to operate one or a few small incisions. Surgeons prefer this machine as it offers flexibility and improved visualisation and also lets them be seated during the procedure. The whole procedure takes around 2 to 4 hours of time.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>In-Vitro-Fertilization (Ivf) Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In-Vitro-Fertilisation is a procedure that helps the infertile women to become pregnant via an assisted method where the eggs of the female and sperms of the male partner are fused outside the body, in an artificial medium in the laboratory, to produce an embryo, which is then placed back in the uterus of the female for further development. This is the best and last treatment option for the women who have blockage in the fallopian tubes and cannot conceive naturally, older women who are not able to conceive due to infertility problems and men who have a very low count of sperms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure For In-Vitro-Fertilization</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The in-vitro-fertilization procedure mainly consists of five important steps that need to be followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>1. Stimulation Of Ovaries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This is the first step of the in-vitro-fertilization in which the woman is given medicines to increase the count of the eggs produced. The medicine aids the ovaries to produce more eggs compared to normal count that is only egg per month. Increase in egg production increases the chances of fertilization to take place. The ovaries are examined on a regular basis via ultrasounds. Hormones levels are monitored during this step of the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Removal Of The Matured Egg From The Ovaries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before the egg removal, it is made sure that the eggs are ripened or mature enough to be taken out. Injections containing medicine to mature the eggs are given. The eggs must be collected at a proper stage of development, neither too early nor too late. If this doesn&rsquo;t happen, it will hinder the development of the eggs.&nbsp; With the help of ultrasound, the doctor will collect the eggs from the ovaries by inserting a hollow tube into the ovaries via vagina. The hollow needle attached to the suction tip will suck the eggs along with the fluid from the ovaries. It is performed under anaesthesia. The duration of the step is usually from 30-60 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. Collecting the Sperms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Semen samples are collected from the male partner. From the sample the sperms are collected and separated in the lab. The healthiest sperms are collected for the fertilization process to take place by putting them in a spin cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>4. Fertilization</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This step involves the union of the sperm with the egg to bring about fertilization and produce embryos. It takes around a few hours for the fertilization to take place. This process is carried out in the laboratory. The fertilized eggs are then kept under observation to ensure their proper growth and until the embryo is formed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>5. Transfer Of The Embryo Into The Uterus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">When the embryo has matured, then it is transferred into the uterus for implantation usually after 3-7 days of the fertilization process. This transfer is carried out by inserting a flexible tube known as Catheter into the uterus via vagina and the cervix. To increase the chances of pregnancy, sometimes 2-3 embryos are transferred at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The duration of the procedure is around several hours followed by immediate bed rest of around 4-6 hours before leaving the clinic. To check the success of the procedure, that is whether the pregnancy is there, pregnancy tests are being performed by the doctor after 14 days of the embryo transfer. Whether the treatment will be a success or not depends upon the factors such as the technique with which the procedure has been performed, types of the eggs used in the treatment, age of the patient, etc.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">An Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury occurs when the ACL is stretched or torn partially or completely. ACL is the tissue connecting the thighbone to the shinbone.&nbsp; Most ACL-related injuries occur while playing sports like basketball, skiing, tennis, and football. Some of the symptoms of the injury include joint swelling, a cracking sound during injury, instability of the knee, and pain. An ACL injury cannot heal on its own due to a lack of blood supply to the damaged area, sportspersons, therefore, mostly need to opt for an ACL injury surgery. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif">During the ACL reconstruction surgery, you will be under general anaesthesia and hence will be asleep during the whole procedure. Small incisions are made by the surgeon around the knee to create entry portals for various arthroscopic and surgical instruments. Once the arthroscopy is inserted, it delivers a saline solution to create space for surgical tools including the arthroscopic camera, which sends footage to a monitor monitored by the surgeons. He or she then evaluates the structures surrounding the ACL, including the left and right meniscus and the articular cartilage. The surgeon repairs the lesions in the soft tissues, if any. A graft from another part of the patient&rsquo;s body is taken and attached to the end to plugs of bone taken from the patella and tibia. These plugs anchor the graft which will become the new ACL. The new ACL is inserted into the femur and tibia with the help of a flexible guidewire. Then, to secure the wire, screws are used. With time, these plugs grow into the surrounding bone. The surgical instruments are then removed. ACL surgery usually takes about two to two and a half hours of time.</span></span></p>\r\n',

    treatment_faqs:
      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. Is ACL surgery painful?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Some patients experience discomfort and pain during the first week after the treatment. But the pain reduces with time. You should have minimal irritation after the first two weeks. Swelling and bruising are common as well but fade away with time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. How soon after ACL surgery can you walk?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> 2-4 weeks after the surgery the patient can walk unassisted and can expect to be able to brisk walk after 10-12 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. What are the risks of ACL surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Missed concomitant injuries, tunnel malposition, patellar fracture, knee stiffness, and infection are some major complications which arise after an ACL surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. How much does an ACL surgery cost?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> An ACL surgery costs approximately 1 lakh in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What happens if one has to wait too long to get ACL surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> In that case, you will get chronic ACL deficiency and your surgeon may not be able to correct all of the joint damage. You are also at a high risk of developing chronic knee pain and instability if you delay the surgery by up to six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. How many postoperative exercises can I do?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> You can do as many as you can. Start with two to three of each at first reaching some more a few hours later. It is appropriate to do some multiple times in a day than by doing many in one go. You must listen to your body and if you feel excess pain and swelling, you should back off a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. How can I minimize scarring?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Use compression as much as you want to. This includes an elastic bandage wrapped from the ankle to just above the knee, elastic stockings, snug, fitting leggings, or a support hose. After the incisions have healed, apply lotion and gently massage along and across each side of the scar. Some people even suggest that the use of vitamin E can help in minimizing scars even though there is no scientific proof of this.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Acne treatment consists of medication and topical therapies that helps to get rid of the acnes. This treatment works to clear the acnes that occurs due to ingrown hair follicles, oil, dirt and dead cells of the skin that usually clog the pores of the skin and leads to acne formation. There are number of acne treatments available which includes Chemical Peel, Microdermabrasion, Steroid Injections, Laser Skin Resurfacing, Dermabrasion, Intense Pulsed Light, Photodynamic Therapy, Medications (oral and topical) and Home Remedies. The duration of the therapy varies according to the type of medication being used. It is usually of 6 months to more than a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for The Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure varies according to the type of treatment opted. In Chemical Peel treatment, after properly cleaning the face, a chemical solution (Salicylic acid, Glycolic acid) is applied on the affected area and left for ten minutes. This is followed by application of the neutraliser to minimise the burning sensation caused by the chemical. Lastly, a moisturiser is applied on the skin. This treatment removes the dead skin cells and unclogs pores that cause acne. In the Laser Skin Resurfacing treatment, topical anaesthesia is applied on the skin followed by laser beam that removes the outermost skin layer until a smooth texture of the skin is obtained. In Microdermabrasion, tiny crystals are sprayed over the skin with the help of a hand piece that exfoliate the skin. The duration of this procedure is usually from 30 to 60 minutes. This is a non surgical procedure. Chemical peel procedure is of three types that is Superficial Peels, Medium Peels and Deep Peels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemical peel procedure starts with the application of chemical peel solution on the skin with help of a brush. The solution is allowed to rest for approximately 10 minutes. This is followed by neutralising solution to neutralise the effect of the chemical being applied. Cold compression is done to avoid any discomfort to skin. Before washing the face and completing the procedure, face mask is applied to sooth the skin surface. The duration of this procedure is quite short (20-30minutes). Photodynamic Therapy is another treatment that is used in case of severe and moderate acne. The procedure starts with application of a photosensitising agent on the skin and dressing the area for nearly 3 hours so that sebaceous glands can absorb it. Then a red or blue light source is targeted on the skin to activate the photosensitising agent that will kill the bacteria, remove the oil by shrinking oil glands. It usually takes two to six weeks to heal the treated areas of the skin completely. Topical Medication involves application of Salicylic acid, Antibiotics (Clindamycin, Benzyl peroxide), Retinoid and Retinoid like products on the skin. These are applied on the on the clean skin surface at night to prevent sun exposure. The duration starts with three times in a week followed by everyday application as the skin become used to it.&nbsp; Oral medications such as Antibiotics, Combined Oral Contraceptives, Anti androgen Agents are Isotretinoin are also included in the treatment regime of acne treatment procedure.</p>\r\n',

The tumour is a result of the malfunction of Schwann cells that form the insulating myelin sheath on the nerves. Normally, Schwann cells protect the nerves which transmit balance and sound information to the brain but mutation in the tumour suppressor gene (NF2) which is located on chromosome 22, leads to abnormal production of the cell protein named merlin in abundance and Schwann cells multiply to form a tumour. As it enlarges, hearing and balance get affected. Although they are non-cancerous, if they grow to press on the cranial nerves and brainstem, they can be life-threatening. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">A hearing test and imaging using MRI or CT scan are conducted by the doctor to identify your hearing ability and to detect the tumour.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">MONITORING: This is recommended in the cases where the tumour is slowly growing or not growing at all.

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Bariatric Surgery which is commonly known as Weight Loss Surgery is a surgical procedure that helps to shed extra body weight by making changes to the digestive system. It is highly beneficial for the obese patients as it reduces the death rate among them. Duration of the surgery, starting from the time of consultation to the actual surgery is around six month long procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Procedure depends on the types of the bariatric surgery performed. There are basically five main types of bariatric surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Sleeve Gastrectomy</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This surgery consists of removal of 80 percent of the stomach using surgical staplers. This reduces the area available to the stomach and as a result it carries less amount of food ultimately leading to less intake of food. The metabolism is affected that gives the feeling of full stomach and less hunger. The duration of the surgery is around one to two hours. It is short surgical procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Adjustable Gastric Band</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This treatment procedure involves placement of silicon device in the uppermost part of the stomach creating a small pouch over there that restricts the quantity of food intake a person can have. It takes around an hour and half for the surgery to complete and the patient can be discharged the same day if no complications arise. Chances of re-operation are higher in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass (Rygb)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This is the most commonly performed procedure of bariatric surgery. It is also known by the name of Gastric Bypass surgery. The procedure starts with division of the upper portion of the stomach into a pouch. The bigger part of stomach is not involved that is bypassed followed by division of small intestines and its attachment to the newly formed stomach for the passage of the food. The small size stomach formed after the surgery stores less food and as a result less calorie intake is there by the person. Though being a highly complex procedure, it is a long lasting treatment option for weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Biliopancreatic Diversion With Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The surgery involves the formation of sleeve like stomach and then separation of the stomach and small intestine followed by its attachment to the newly formed stomach. When the patient eats something, it will first travel to sleeve pouch of the newly formed stomach and then to the small intestine. Due to the newly formed stomach, the patient will not be eating much food that results in decrease in calorie intake and nutrients and hence controlled body weight. As the intake of nutrients is also decreased, so patient is advised to take vitamins and mineral supplements additionally. This the best treatment option in case of type 2 diabetes patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Single Anastomosisdoudeno-Ileal Bypass With Sleeve Gastrectomy (SADI-S)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This procedure is quite similar to the BPD-DS procedure but takes lesser timer and is simple procedure. In this a small tube shaped stomach is formed followed by division of the small intestines first part and then after measurement, it is attached to the stomach. The treatment works with entrance of food into small pouch of the stomach and thereafter into the latter portion of small intestine where it absorbs nutrients, thus offering energy and a sense of fullness with fewer intakes of calories. The duration of this surgery is around 2 hours and it is done with laparoscopic method and hence is less invasive and the patient is discharged within 2-3 days after the surgery.</p>\r\n',

The replacement cells involved in the treatment are either from the donor or from the very own body of an individual. There are other names also that are used for this treatment that are Stem cell Transplant or hematopoietic treatment.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Procedure for Treatment:</strong></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">This treatment is indicated in the case of diseases such as Hodgkin&rsquo;s and non Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma, Myeloma, Leukemia where stem cell are taken from the body of the individual itself and Thalassemia,&nbsp; aplastic anemia, chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Relapsed Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia and several other Genetic Disorders with single gene effects, where the stem cells are taken from the donor. The sources of the stem cells include the peripheral blood stem cells, Umbilical cord stem cells and the bone marrow. There are mainly two types of bone marrow transplant. 1) Autologous Transplant: In this procedure the stem cells come from the body of the patient itself. 2) Allogenic Transplant: The stem cells in this procedure are taken from body of the donor.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">The treatment process does not involve any surgery and is not fatal. The treatment involves infusion of the stem cells into patient via live Blood Transfusion .Once introduced at the target site the stem cells grow in the same manner as the other cells in the human body grow, followed by their division and maturation. Once stem cells develop completely, they start forming the other types of blood cells that are the white blood cells, the red blood cells and platelets. The stem cells have the ability to regenerate within few days. This is the reason for having over 10 million volunteer donors for the bone marrow transplant in the United States of America. To find a donor match is the most important step of this type of transplant. The donor should be a healthy individual whose blood proteins i.e. Human Leukocyte antigens closely resemble the recipient&rsquo;s blood proteins. In many cases finding a suitable donor is not a success, then there other options for that are as follows: 1) Taking stems cells from the umbilical cord. 2) Parent &ndash;child transplant although showing 50 percent match, doctors are using it. The duration of the procedure is around 1-2 hours the patient is kept under observation on the same day of the surgery and is ready to be discharged the very next day.</span></span></p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Cancers in the brain result from abnormal growths of cells in the brain. They can arise from primary cells, the cells from other brain elements like membrane or blood vessels, or from other organs&rsquo; cancer cells which spread to the brain (metastatic cancer). All growths in the brain are not cancerous, some can be benign. A malign tumour is composed of cancerous cells and multiplies and spreads aggressively, invading and infecting other organs as well. These tumours are referred to as cancer. The types of brain cancers include primary and metastatic tumours. The tumours which result from the transformation and abnormal growth of brain cells are called primary brain tumours which include gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, and vestibular schwannomas, primary CNS lymphomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumours (medulloblastomas). Metastatic brain tumours emerge from other locations in the body to the brain. These are the most common form of brain tumours and are cancerous as well. Commonly, the cancers starting in the lungs, breasts and kidneys are the ones that spread to the brain. Radiation to the head, hereditary causes, HIV infection, smoking and environmental toxins like the chemicals used in oil refineries and rubber industries are some probable causes of primary brain tumours. The symptoms and warning signs of these tumours are headaches, muscle weakness, paresthesia, clumsiness, difficulty in walking and seizures. Other non-specific brain cancer symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abnormalities in vision, difficulty with speech, gradual changes in intellectual or emotional capacity and altered mental status.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For the diagnosis, tests like CT scans, blood and liver tests, urine test, blood coagulation tests, MRI and biopsy might be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery for resection of tumour- The aim of the surgery is to minimize brain function damage. For most patients, the surgery is done under general anaesthesia. Other surgeries are done awake or under light sedation to map language functionalities. In the surgeries done under anaesthesia, an endotracheal tube is placed and in the ones where the patient is awake, a laryngeal mask airway (sometimes no airway is placed) is placed and the patient is given sedation. A clamp system holds the skull of the patient and holds the head appropriately.&nbsp; A navigation system guides the surgeons to determine the exact location of the incision. The hair is clipped, the scalp prepared and the incision line is infiltrated with anaesthesia. The scalp is then pushed aside to expose the skull bone. Temporarily, a portion of the skull is removed and the lining tissues of the brain are opened. In case, it is mandatory can you check the brain functioning, patient is awakened in between. Then, a portion of the brain is sent for a checkup to the pathologist. Biodegradable chemotherapy drugs (Wafers) may also be placed inside the tumour by the surgeon. After the tumour resection is complete, the surrounding membranes and the skull are closed with screws and titanium plates that hold it in the desired position. The scalp is then closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Stereotactic radiosurgery- A newer approach to destroying brain cancer without opening the skull is stereotactic radiosurgery. To get the exact point of the tumour CT or MRI scans are done. High energy radiations are then trained on the tumour site which destroys the tumour. The advantages of knifeless surgery include lesser healing time and fewer complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiation therapy- This is a local treatment that harms cells in its way and not the surrounding cells. For patients who cannot undergo surgery due to age, health and other problems, this is the option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">External radiation therapy uses an external machine through which high energy radiation is targeted at the tumour. It travels through the skin, the skull and healthy brain tissue to get at the tumour. The gamma knife and cyberknife are the techniques used to kill the tumour. Each treatment takes only a couple of minutes and is given five days a week for about six weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Internal/Implant radiation uses a radioactive substance that is implanted in the tumour, the radiations of which destroy the tumour. The patient needs to stay in the hospital for receiving this treatment for several days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy-Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill a tumour. These drugs are given either intravenously through a tube inserted in your vein or orally through the mouth. A single drug or a combination of drugs can be used. Chemotherapy is given in cycles which include a short period of intensive treatment followed by a period of rest and recovery. Each cycle lasts for a few weeks.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">It is a medical condition in which improper blood flow to the brain causes cell death. Ischemic stroke is caused due to lack of blood flow and hemorrhagic due to bleeding. Inability to move, loss of vision on one side, and problems understanding or speaking may be some symptoms of a brain stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">An Ischemic Stroke:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Emergency IV medication- An IV injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which is also terme alteplase (Activase) or tenecteplase (TNKase)is the gold standard treatment for ischemic stroke but has to be given within 4.5 hours of when the symptoms started through a vein in the arm. This drug dissolves the blood clot causing the stroke and also helps you to recover from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Emergency endovascular procedures &ndash; These procedures are done directly inside the blocked blood vessels. These are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Medications delivered directly to the brain&ndash;A long, thin tube (catheter) is inserted through an artery in the groin and is threaded to the brain to deliver TPA directly at the location of the stroke. The time period for this is longer than the time period for injected TPA but is limited still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Removing the clot with a stent retriever &ndash;Doctors may use a catheter to directly remove the clot from the blocked blood vessel in the brain. This process is mostly performed in combination with injected TPA and is helpful to remove clots that cannot be removed by TPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Hemorrhagic Stroke:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery&ndash;For a large area of bleeding, doctors would recommend surgery to remove the blood and relieve the brain. It may also be used to relieve blood vessel problems related to hemorrhagic strokes. The surgery usually takes about 2 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgical clipping &ndash;A tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm is placed by the doctor to stop the blood from flowing into it. This clamp can keep the aneurysm from bursting or from bleeding again. It must be done within 72 hours of the bleed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Coiling (endovascular embolization) &ndash;The surgeon places tiny detachable coils into the aneurysm to fill it using a catheter inserted into an artery in the groin guided to the brain which causes the blood flow in the aneurysm to stop and form a blood clot. The process usually takes 2-4 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgical AVM removal &ndash;If the AVM is located in an accessible area of the brain the surgeons may remove it. It reduces the chances of rupture and lowers the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. It is not possible to remove an AVM if it is present deep within the brain or if it is large as it could cause a deep impact on the brain. The procedure can take 3 to 8 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Stereotactic radio surgery &ndash;It is an advanced, minimally invasive treatment, used to repair blood vessel malformations.

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">When abnormal cells develop within the brain, tumours are formed. They can be cancerous or non-cancerous. Primary tumours start within the brain and secondary tumours start from tumours outside the brain. The cause of most brain tumours is unknown. The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending upon the type, size and location of the tumour in the brain. Some warning signs and symptoms include seizures, difficulty in sleeping, memory problems, headaches, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, sensory (vision, smell and hearing) changes, personality changes or mood swings, difficulty performing mundane activities and drowsiness. The different types of brain tumours which exist are Medulloblastomas, Pituitary adenomas, Acoustic neuromas, Meningiomas, Germ cell tumours, Craniopharyngiomas and Gliomas. Exposure to radiation and family history are some factors that may increase your risk of getting a brain tumour.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For the diagnosis, your doctor might ask you to get tests like MRI scans, CT scans and neurologic exams done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For the treatment, there are several options like radiation therapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Most of the time, you could get a combination of all of these depending upon the type, size, location of the tumour and the patient&rsquo;s age and health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery&ndash;Before the surgery, your scalp is shaved. There is complete or partial resection of the tumour with the objective being the removal of as many tumour cells as possible. If the tumour is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgery may not be possible. Though the recovery time differs from person to person, you will have to spend a few days in the hospital. Surgery typically takes about 4 to 6 hours of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiotherapy- Radiation therapy usually follows surgery. It includes killing tumour cells with powerful rays like x-rays, gamma rays or protons. It can be either external or internal. In external radiotherapy direct beams are aimed at the entire brain or a part of the brain with the help of a large machine. The schedule depends upon the type and size of the tumour and the age of the person. In internal radiation therapy, seeds are implanted inside the brain to give off radiation for months. Radiotherapy treatments spread out over weeks and each treatment generally takes about 10 to 30 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy- It is sometimes used to treat brain tumours and includes giving drugs orally or intravenously through a thin short tube that goes into your vein or through a long central line ( a PICC) put into a large vein in your chest or you could get chemotherapy through wafers (chemotherapy implants) or Ommaya reservoirs (in this treatment a plastic dome is placed under your scalp and chemotherapy is given straight into the fluid spaces in your brain). It may be given with or after radiotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You will need regular check-ups after the treatment to ensure your health. Chemotherapy would typically last for 6-12 months with 6-12 cycles.</p>\r\n',

In surgical breast implantation, the augmentation created of the breast hemisphere is spherical, using an implant filled with either a saline solution or silicone gel. However, in the fat-graft transfer approach, it is the contour defects of the breast hemisphere that is augmented using the grafts of the adipocyte fat tissue drawn from the person&rsquo;s body itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The surgery begins with anesthesia. You will be given either intravenous or general anesthesia based on your body. Incisions are made in unobtrusive areas to minimize visible scarring. Your surgeon would discuss with you the possible incision options which include - along the areolar edge (peri-areolar incision), the fold under the breast (inframammary fold), and in the armpit (axillary incision). When complication rates are high, a belly-button approach is taken up. After the incision is made, the breast implant is inserted into a pocket either under the pectoral muscle which is a submuscular placement, or directly behind the breast tissue over the pectoral muscle which is a Submammary/Subglandular placement. The method of inserting the implant is decided by the surgeon based on the type of implant, the degree of enlargement desired, and your body type. Lastly, incisions are closed with layered sutures in the breast tissue and with sutures, skin adhesive, or surgical tape. Over time the incisions fade away based on the exposure to infection and nicotine and your genetics as well. The procedure takes around 45 minutes to an hour.</p>\r\n',

Will breast augmentation increase my risk of breast cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Studies have shown no increase in the risk of getting breast cancer in women after getting breast augmentation surgery. Breast implant patients have a chance of obtaining remission or being free of cancer for around 5 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. Am I too old for the surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Women who go for breast surgery in their 40s and 50s have seen good results. The most common patients are women with 2 children in her 30s.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. Will my nipple sensation or feeling change?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Most women will have a loss of sensation for 6-12 months after the surgery. However, 15% of the women will have permanently altered sensations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. How long should I wait until I can exercise?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Walking is recommended immediately after the surgery but physical exercises including&nbsp; weight lifting, jogging, biking and other forms of intense activities may hinder the healing process and may cause implants to shift positions. Therefore, these physical activities are not advised for a period of 6 weeks following the operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. Will breast augmentation work on me if I have sagging breasts?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>&lsquo;Ptosis&rsquo; or the condition of sagging breasts in women where the nipples droop lower than the crease of the breast, can be fixed by a breast lift surgery. This surgery does add scars around the nipple- areola area unlike most breast augmentation surgeries but the placement of implants in the breasts without undergoing this fat removal surgery might not be effective in correcting sagging breasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. What are the risks related to breast augmentation?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Breast augmentation poses several risks including capsular contracture (scar tissue that distorts the shape of the breast implant), changes in nipple and breast sensation, infection, implant leakage or rupture, and changes in implant position. Correcting these complications might require more surgeries including removal or replacement of the implants.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Breast cancer is the type of cancer that starts either in one or both the breasts. When there is an abnormal growth of cells, cancer begins. A tumour in the breast can be benign or cancerous. A benign tumour is harmless but can increase the risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer mainly occurs in women but can occur in men too. The Breast can start from different parts of the breast like the lobules, ducts, nipple, the fat and connective tissue or the blood and lymph vessels. A small number of cancers begin in other parts of the breast known as sarcomas and lymphomas. Breast cancer can spread if the cancer cells move into the blood or the lymph system, travelling to other parts of the body. If the cancer cells have entered the lymph nodes, there is a probability of cancer reaching the other parts of the body as well. But, not every woman with cancer cells in her lymph nodes gets metastases and some women even get metastases later when there are no cancerous cells in her lymph nodes. The types of cancers in the breast include carcinomas (adenocarcinomas and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) being the most common), angiosarcoma and sarcoma. Angiosarcoma and sarcoma are not considered breast cancers as they start from different cells in the breast. Certain causes of breast cancer remain unknown but the risk factors include drinking alcohol, obesity, not being active physically, not having children, not breastfeeding, birth control, menopause hormone therapies and breast implants. The risks which are non-changeable are being female, getting older, having a family history of breast cancer, inheriting certain gene changes, race and ethnicity, having dense breast tissue and having benign breast conditions like non-proliferating lesions and proliferating lesions with atypia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery- Surgery is the removal of the tumour and a little surrounding tissue as well. It is also used to examine the auxiliary lymph nodes nearby, under the arm. The smaller the tumour,&nbsp; more the options available for the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Breast-conserving surgery or Lumpectomy- In this procedure the tumour along with a little margin of the healthy tissue is removed, leaving behind most of the breast. The procedure is done under general anaesthesia which puts you in a sleep-like state. The surgeon will make a small incision over the area containing the wire ( which was inserted to locate the tumour). He/she will then remove the tumour with some of the surrounding tissue and send it further for lab analysis. If you are having a sentinel node biopsy or the axillary lymph node dissection, he will do the same for the sentinel lymph node and the axillary lymph node. The incision will then be closed, keeping in check the appearance of the breast using stitches. Adhesive strips may also be used by the surgeon to keep the stitches in place temporarily until they heal. The procedure takes about one hour to complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Mastectomy- It is an umbrella term for the removal of one or both the breasts along with the lymph nodes. You are given general anaesthesia and the surgeon starts by making an elliptical incision around your breast. Depending upon the tumour, different parts of your breast are removed. After the surgery and after the procedure of breast reconstruction (if you choose to get it done), the incisions are closed with sutures that may dissolve later on or will be removed. Tubes will be placed where your breast was removed to remove any fluids that accumulate after the surgery. The operation takes around 90 minutes and you can expect the healing time to be 4 to 6 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Sentinel node biopsy-You will probably be under general anaesthesia. The surgeon will make an incision in the area above the lymph nodes. If the radioactive solution is used before the procedure, a small instrument called the gamma detector will be used by the surgeon to determine if radioactivity has accumulated for identifying the sentinel nodes. Blue die stains the sentinel nodes bright blue and helps the surgeon to see them. Then the sentinel nodes are removed by the surgeon. There are one to five sentinels in every case. The treatment takes around 45 minutes of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Axillary lymph node dissection-You will be under general anaesthesia while your doctor makes an incision under the arm and removes 10 to 40 lymph nodes of levels 1 and 2. After the removal of the lymph nodes, the surgeon places a drain and closes the cut with stitches or staples. To collect the draining fluid and to improve the healing process, a drainage bag is attached to the drain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiation therapy-In radiation therapy, high powered radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays are used to kill cancer. It can be done using a machine (external therapy) or using wafers that are implanted in the tumour (internal radiation therapy). Generally, after a lumpectomy, external beam radiation of the whole breast is used. Breast cancer radiation treatment can last from three days to six weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy-The process of usage of a single or a combination of drugs to fight cancer cells is called chemotherapy. The drugs are given intravenously or orally. If there is a chance that your cancer will return after the surgery, your doctor will recommend chemotherapy to you. It is done in cycles with one sitting and then a period of rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Hormone therapy- It is done when the cancers are sensitive to hormones. Medications can be given that block hormones from attaching to cancer cells or inhibit the body from producing estrogen after menopause or stop hormone production in the ovaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Targeted therapy- In this treatment, the genes, proteins or the tissue environment of cancer which contributes to its growth and survival is targeted. HER2 targeted therapy in which drugs like trastuzumab, pertuzumab, neratinib and ado-trastuzumab emtansine are used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Immunotherapy- This treatment uses materials from either the patient&rsquo;s body or from the outside are used to improve the immune system of the body of the patient. Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy approved by the FDA to treat early-stage, triple-negative, high-risk breast cancer in combination with chemotherapy before surgery.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">This surgery is also known as reduction mammaplasty, breast reduction surgery is a procedure to remove excess fat, skin and glandular tissue from your breasts which cause pain in your neck and back, chronic rash under your breasts, restricted activity and nerve pain, and are not in proportion with the rest of your body. It is done to alleviate the discomfort caused by macromastia (excessively large breasts). Mostly, mammaplasty is done regarding concern for medical issues related to large breasts and the problems which they pose in the daily lives of the patients but women who are unhappy with the size of their breasts can get it done for cosmetic purposes as well. Most women who get the surgery are highly satisfied with the results. Men with conditions like gynecomastia -where male breasts are abnormally enlarged, can also have it</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before the treatment, your doctor will talk to you about your medical history, if you have had a lump removed from your breast earlier or any other medications affecting your breasts. You may also get a mammogram and a breast exam before the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Anesthesia is administered as the first step and your choices include intravenous or general anesthesia. Incisions are either made in a circular pattern around the areola, like a keyhole with an incision around the areola or vertically down to the breast crease, in an inverted T (anchor-shaped) pattern. After the incision is made, the nipple is repositioned while it remains connected to its original nerve and blood supply. The breast tissue underneath is reduced, lifted and reshaped. For large pendulous breasts, occasionally, the nipple would need to be removed and placed in a higher position on the breast. The incisions are then brought together and closed to reshape the now smaller breast. For supporting the reshaped breasts, sutures are layered deep within the breast tissue. Sutures, surgical tape and skin adhesives are used to close the skin. Incision lines are permanent but improve over time and fade away in most cases. A breast reduction surgery may take about two to five hours of time or even more sometimes.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. How much does a breast reduction surgery cost?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> In India, the cost of breast reduction surgery starts from Rs. 90,000. The average cost is Rs.&nbsp; 1,30,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. Will there be any scar on the breast after the surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>Yes, there will be a scar but it will not be clearly visible. The Skin elasticity of the patient also plays a role in this. Some people have a tendency to form prominent scars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. Is breast reduction different from a breast lift?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>Breast lift is done to lift overly sagging breasts whereas breast reduction is performed to down the size of the breasts. Both of the procedures are different but may have to be combined for better results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. Does breast reduction surgery increase my risk for cancer the breast?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>No, breast reduction surgery does not increase the risk for breast cancer. According to a published study, breast reduction lowers the chances of attracting cancer for a few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. Can the patient breastfeed after the surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>The surgery might cause you to not be able to breastfeed your child temporarily as the surgery entails the nipple and areola to be relocated.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. Is breast reduction surgery safe?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>All surgeries carry with them some risk of complications but a breast reduction surgery is typically safer. The most common complications include infections, loss of nipple sensation and the scars that come with breast reduction. Most people have an anchor-shaped scar that will be red at first but will fade away with time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. Is the breast reduction procedure painful?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>During the procedure, you will be in anaesthesia and can expect to not experience any kind of pain. But for the next two to three days you can expect to feel sore. You will be prescribed pain medications by the doctor. Also, you can place wrapped ice packs gently over the area, as advised by the doctor to help with the pain and soreness. In case your pain does not recede over a few day time, do contact your care team immediately.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">The liver&rsquo;s function is to help filter waste put in the body, make bile to aid in digesting food, store sugar used for energy, and make proteins that work in different places in the body. Excess consumption of alcohol affects all organs of the body; mostly the liver as it is being given more than it can digest, leading to Alcoholic Liver Disease which further leads to the building of fat, inflammation, and fatalistic scarring in the liver. It is the primary cause of liver disease in Western countries. The alcoholic liver disease begins with a fatty liver and progresses to alcoholic hepatitis (second stage) and finally develops into cirrhosis (final stage). If you have fatty liver disease, which is the first stage of liver damage, the damage will be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least two weeks. If a person has cirrhosis and refrains from alcohol consumption, damage to the liver will stop but the scars would remain. In the case of alcoholic hepatitis, it is mandatory for the patient to abstain from alcohol &ndash; it may lead to improvements but is not sufficient to stop the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tests like blood tests, liver function tests, MRI, and liver biopsy might be required. Abstinence of alcohol is vital before starting the treatment of alcoholic liver disease. You can also go for certain therapeutic procedures which are of supportive nature. An aggressive nutritional therapy including an increase in the intake of vitamins and minerals is then recommended by the doctors to rectify malnutrition. Medicines based on the stage and condition are given to the patient after proper screening. For patients with end-stage liver disease, who do not respond to any other treatment, a liver transplant is recommended, the prime eligibility factor being abstinence from alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The exact duration of liver improvement varies from one patient to another, although, you will start seeing beneficial results within a week, just after you stop drinking alcohol.</p>\r\n',

How much does the treatment for alcoholic liver disease cost?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Liver cirrhosis treatment costs in India range from 12 Lakhs to 15 Lakhs approximately.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. Since the treatment effects are not long-lasting, can the treatment be given again?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Unless the patient resumes alcohol consumption and returns with an exacerbation of alcoholic hepatitis, the treatment is not given again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. What are the symptoms of liver disease?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The most common symptoms are non&ndash;specific. They include fatigue, excessive tiredness, lack of drive and sometimes itching as well. Prominent signs of liver disease include jaundice, yellow eyes and skin, dark urine, bleeding from the GI tract, very pale-colored stool, and mental confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What other toxic substances damage the liver apart from alcohol?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Acetaminophen, which is the safest medication for fevers, aches, and pains, if taken in higher amounts, can result in liver damage or failure. Inhaled toxins like cleaning solvents, aerosolized paints, thinners, etc. are dangerous as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. Can liver damage be reversed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> It can only be reversed in the initial stages of liver damage. Cirrhosis indicates late-stage liver disease and cannot be reversed. It is followed usually by an onset of complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. What are the complications of alcoholic liver disease?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The complications related to alcoholic liver disease are hepatitis B and C.&nbsp; About 30% of the people would have hepatitis C and the others would have hepatitis B. Also, people with ALD are at a greater risk for liver cancer and about 50% of people have gallstones. The ones with cirrhosis mostly develop kidney problems, internal bleeding, liver cancer, severe infections, and fluid in the belly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. What lifestyle changes will I need to make?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The ultimate change is abstinence from alcohol. Good nutritional support and regular medications like Disulfiram or Naltrexone will be prescribed by the doctor. If abstinence from alcohol and good nutrition is maintained, there can be an improvement in hepatitis condition as well.</p>\r\n',

The surgical technique followed may be either conventional or minimally invasive technique. Before the surgery began, it is made sure that the patient is fit enough for the surgery by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, chest X-rays, Electrocardiogram and physical examination of the patient. Complete medical history of the patient is taken which includes drug allergies, any minor or serious medical condition and any bad habits such as smoking. Patient is advised not to eat anything at least 8-10 hours before the surgery. The patient is connected to the ventilator and breathing tube is inserted into the mouth. Ventilator and heart/lung bypass machine is used as the heart is stopped while the surgery and circulation and vitals are maintained via ventilator and heart-lung bypass machine. Incision is given on the chest region. The length of the incision depends upon the method of surgical procedure chosen. For minimally invasive surgery small length incision is given. In Open heart surgery the length of incision is bigger. This is followed by removal of the diseased heart valve and placement of artificial valve at its place. After the surgery is completed, Heart is restarted by giving shock to the heart via small paddles. Now the blood that was circulating with the help of heart -lung bypass machine is made to re-enter heart. When the heart starts beating normally, it observed for a while to check it&rsquo;s proper working and the working of the new valve placed. The incision is sutured and sterile bandage is applied over it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">After the surgery, patient is kept under observation in the intensive care unit for several days. ECG, blood pressure oxygen level, heart rate and breathing rates are monitored continuously. The patient becomes stables after the breathing and stomach tubes are removed. The duration of the treatment is usually 3hours or may be longer. Complications associated with the surgery include bleeding during or after the surgery, blood clot, breathing problem, pneumonia, pancreatitis, Arrhythmias and sometimes death. Patient is advised to immediately consult the doctor if he or she have high fever, swelling and drainage from the incision site, Redness, pain around the incision site and rapid or irregular pulp.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Leukaemia is the cancer of blood-forming tissues including the bone marrow and obstructs the ability of the body to fight against infections. Various symptoms for the identification of leukemia include getting tired easily, pale skin tone, fever, easy bleeding, easy bruising and nosebleeds, bone or joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, groin, or stomach, frequent infections,&nbsp; weight loss, shortness of breath, night sweats and little energy and weakness. Lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are the types of leukemia that can be treated through different treatment options available including radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplant (bone marrow transplant). Chemotherapy is the most common form of treatment for cancer including most types of Leukemia as well. It aims at destroying cancer, prolonging life or relieving its symptoms by shrinking tumors that cause pain through variable combinations of medicines/ potent drugs or chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">You may receive chemotherapy at home, in a doctor&rsquo;s office or in a hospital. Based on the type and stage of the blood cancer, the patients receive chemotherapy by mouth, as a cream, through a catheter, or intravenously (through an IV). Some chemotherapy drugs are taken in the form of capsules, some are given by inserting a tube with a needle into a vein or into a device in a vein in your chest. The treatment is cyclic - you can get it every day, week, or month. The body of the patient is given sufficient time to heal, strengthen and build healthy cells. A basic chemo regimen lasts for 5 minutes to 8 or more hours. Deciding the dosage of chemotherapy can be problematic - a low dosage could be ineffective and the toxicity of high dosage could be intolerable for the patient. Due to the lack of a better option, the BSA formula has been adopted since 1950 to determine the adequate dosage for chemotherapy. Measuring the blood levels in the blood plasma over time according to a formula or algorithm can help in achieving optimal exposure. Dosing is personalized to achieve target exposure and optimal results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy is an undoubtedly effective treatment but has many side effects, the most common being the destruction of fast-dividing cells of the body - cells lining the mouth, stomach and intestines and blood cells resulting in side effects like nausea, extreme hair fall, vomiting and fatigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The cycle of Chemotherapy varies from once every week or once every three weeks. The treatment may go up to three to four months but the doctor will adjust the timings according to your situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The patients with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) and ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) usually receive the treatment in two phases:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">1. Induction therapy-Patients go through various cycles of treatment in the hospital and will spend four to six weeks undergoing the therapy. Induction therapy attempts to kill as many AML and ALL cells as possible with chemotherapy and to get rid of any signs of disease left in the body. It also aims at bringing back the blood count of the body to normal. One cycle generally consists of a week of receiving drugs followed by many weeks of recovery and resting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">2. Post Remission Therapy-After the completion of Induction therapy, patients still need to undergo additional therapy which is post remission therapy, also known as consolidation therapy. If you skip this step, chances of the cancer returning are high. The therapy includes chemotherapy and a sometimes a stem transplant as well. Its purpose is to destroy the stray leukemic cells not found by any blood or marrow tests. You can get this done in a hospital or an outpatient setting over a period of four to six weeks or longer depending upon the treatment and it&rsquo;s side-effects. The overall health and the availability of a stem cell donor determine the type of post-remission therapy that patients need.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Cochlear Implant is an electronic device of a very small size that is used as a hearing aid for deaf patients or the one that has very less ability to hear. The device basically consists of an external part that has a microphone to catch the sounds in the surroundings that fits behind the ear of the patient and an internal part that is placed inside the skin of the ear surgically. The other parts are a Speech Processor that arranges and processes the sound picked by the microphone, a Transmitter that receives the signals from the Speech Processor and convert it into the electrical signals and lastly an Electrode Array that collect the impulses generated by the processor and send it to the auditory nerve regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="color:black">Procedure</span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The placement of the cochlear implant starts with giving general anesthesia to the patient as it is placed surgically inside the patient. It starts with taking a complete medical history of the patient and checking if the implant placement is the best suitable option for the patient. A small incision behind the ear and the mastoid bone is drilled to reach to the target, which is the inner ear. Before giving an incision, the area is thoroughly sterilized and hairs are shaved from that area. After that, the implant is placed under the skin and the electrode part of the implant is placed into the inner ear portion. After the placement of the implant, certain tests are performed to check the response of the patient to the implant. Incisions are closed thereafter with disposable sutures and dressing is done on the operated area. Instructions are given to the patient about when and how to remove the dressing. The length of the procedure is very short. The implant is turned on after 4 weeks of the surgery. It takes 1.5-2 hours for the surgery to get completed. The implant may be placed in both or in only one ear. In infants and children, it is placed in both the ears. An Audiologist or an auditory based therapist guides the patient to hear best with the cochlear implant. The performance of the cochlear implant is based upon a number of factors that includes the duration for how long and at what age the patient had lost his /her hearing ability, cause of the hearing loss and most importantly the placement of the cochlear implant. The patient may get back to normal routine within a few days after the surgery and take extra care of the implant area.</p>\r\n',

Blood tests and general checkups of the patient are done to ensure if the patient is suitable for the surgery. With the help of Angiogram Temne location of the blockage in the arteries is detected. Patient is advised to fast for 6-7 hours before the surgery begins. The patient vitals are monitored and patient is linked to a heart monitor to observe the heart function throughout the surgery. The patient is injected with local anaesthesia. Small incision is made in the area where is pulse can be felt. Small sheath is inserted into the incised area of the artery to keep it open during the surgery followed by catheter Boeing inserted through this sheath to the artery. Then a flexible wire is inserted into artery via catheter. A small balloon is inserted via the wire and is inflated for 20-30 seconds. This will lead to the breakdown of the clot or any fatty material inside the artery. The inflation of the balloon is done several times to remove the blockage. The patient may experience some pain when the balloon is inflated and that goes away when the balloon is deflated. After the procedure the artery is checked if the blood is flowing properly through it properly by inserting a contrast dye and observing its flow through the artery. After that the catheter, sheath and balloon and the wire is removed. If there is any bleeding it is stopped by putting pressure over the area. The length of coronary angioplasty is around 2 hours and takes longer sometimes. The patient is kept under observation for 24 hours after the surgery and is advised to stay in the hospital.

It reduces the risk of death that may occur due to coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease. It makes use of blood vessels from other parts of the body. The number of blood vessels used depends upon the severity and the number of blockages present. The blood vessels for the grafting are usually the arteries from the arm or chest region or veins from the leg region.

Blood tests and diagnostic tests are performed to check for any abnormalities such as clot. Patient is advised not to eat or drink at least 8 hours prior to the surgery. The surgery begins with giving anaesthesia to the patient. After that breathing tube is inserted via throat and it is connected to the ventilator to provide the patient life support during the surgery. Catheter is inserted to drain the urine. The heart rate and blood pressure are monitored continuously during the surgical procedure. Then incision is given in the legs or the wrist to find the blood vessels that need to be used for the graft purpose. After finding the blood vessel, the incision is closed. Now the doctor will give an incision in the chest region to expose your heart. The heart of the patient is made to stop temporarily by putting and heart lung bypass machine is used to pump the blood from the heart to the body.Once the heart has been stopped, grafting procedure will began, by connecting the one end of the vein with the tiny opening made on the aorta and the other end is connected to the coronary artery below the blockage. The number of grafts needed may depend upon the amount of the blockage present. Once all the grafts has been put in place and once they are checked, the blood from heart lung bypass machine is sent back to heart and once the heart restarts either on its own or after giving shock, the heart lung bypass machine is removed. In some cases, heart lung bypass machine is not used and hence heart is still working during the surgery. In such cases the area around the artery to be bypassed is stabilised with the help of a special instrument. After the procedure is completed the incision are sutured and a sterile bandage is placed on the incised area. Once the patient body starts responding and breathing and heart beat is back, breathing tube is then removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The patient is kept under observation after the surgery and all the vitals are carefully monitored. The patient can drink and eat after the breathing tube and catheter are removed. Patient is advised to take proper rest and clean the operated area properly.

Incision is made in the blood vessel groin or the wrist region b followed by insertion of wire through it which will act as a guide during the surgery. Catheter with tiny balloon on its one end is inserted and it is inflated in the narrow artery. This will open up the narrow artery and make space for the blood to flow.

After this a plastic tube is inserted into the incised areas through which the catheter will be inserted and reach the heart. Once the catheter is attached to the coronary artery a contrast dye will be injected into it to see the narrow part of the coronary artery followed by taking several images of the site via X-ray. Through these images the narrowed artery will be located and the catheter will be inserted into it and the ballon attached to it will be inflated. Inflated balloon will make space in the narrow artery and allow easy flow of the blood through it. The images are taken to check if the artery has opened properly and blood flow is there and thereafter catheter and the plastic tube is removed.

It is a test to evaluate the heart function. In this test electrodes are placed at particular locations in the chest and further connected to the ECG to check the electrical activity of the heart.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">CT Coronary angiogram is a Heart imaging testing technique that is used for detecting plaque deposits in the arteries of the heart. It is used to identify blocked arteries, risks of heart attack, irregular heart rates, difficulties in breathing and chest pains. The patient is exposed to radiations in the CT Coronary Angiogram.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure Of Ct Coronary Angiogram</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before the procedure begins, the patient is advised not to eat anything for at lest 4-5 hours before the testing. Complete medical hosting of the patient is taken. Patient is asked about any allergy he or she have, any medication they are talking before the procedure starts. As the technique makes use of X-ray radiations, it is performed in the radiology department. The patient is made to lie down on a hollow donut like machine. Electrodes are attached to the patient&rsquo;s body. The patient is given beta blockers to slow down the heart and to monitor the heart rate and rhythmic the heart properly. The vitals signs of the patient are maintained throughout. Tosee affected arteries, a contrast dye is injected via the arm or hand of the patient by giving local anaesthesia before injecting the dye to minimise the discomfort to patient.The CT machine is operated by a technician from another room that separated by glass window form the examination room.The X-ray machine will click the images of patient from different angles. Movement of the patient is restricted to avoid distortion in the images obtained. After the procedure the patient is advised to take lots of fluid to flush out the dye that has been injected in the body.The procedure takes around one hour that includes making the patient ready for the procedure and beta blockers and dye insertion. It is non surgical technique and patient is all set to leave immediately after the procedure is completed. The diagnosis made on the basis of the abnormal test results includes any obstruction or blockage, reduced blood flow to the artery, atherosclerosis and Congenital heart disease. The advised treatment for these abnormalities includes balloon angioplasty or stunt implantation for opening the blocked arteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Pregnant ladies are advised not to go for CT Coronary angiogram as the radiation may impose serious risk.Regardless of the test results; patient is advised to exercise regularly, stop smoking, eat healthy food and adopt a healthy lifestyle and reduce stress. The risk involved in the procedure includes the radiation exposure, contrast dye may pose a problem for the diabetic and kidney disease patients as it takes longer time for them to flush out he dye from their body and they to drinks extra amount of water to flush out the dye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">As this dye material contains iodine, it may cause some allergy reactions in some patients such as itching, skin rashes, difficulty in breathing and cardiac arrest.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Also known as Extracorporeal life support (ECLS), it is an extracorporeal technique for providing respiratory and cardiac support for a prolonged time to the people whose hearts and lungs fail to provide an adequate amount of gas exchange or perfusion for living. A working ECMO consists of a pump, an artificial lung, blood warmer and a filter. Unfortunately, the ECMO does not save everyone but does greatly influence the quality of survival of thousands of people who are critically ill and the people who do not respond to other life saving treatments in the hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before the procedure, you are given medications to numb any pain. One thin, flexible, plastic tube called cannula is placed into the veins or arteries of the patient by the surgeon which draws blood and the second tube is placed to return the blood to the body of the patient. The blood vessels can be located in the chest, groin or neck. A different number of tubes maybe placed by the doctor depending upon the usage of the ECMO. The ECMO machine pulls out the blood without the oxygen and pushes it into the machine&rsquo;s artificial lung (the oxygenator). Here the carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and oxygen is added. The darker blood with no oxygen becomes light as soon as oxygen is added to it. This blood is further warmed before returning to the patient. You may be given other medications to make you feel comfortable during the ECMO process and you may not be able to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Based on your condition, you may be given ECMO for a few days till a few weeks.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_faqs:
      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1 What medical conditions make someone eligible for ECMO?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>The conditions vary but include severe pneumonia, severe forms of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe asthma (status asthmaticus), pulmonary hypertensive crisis, massive pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), acute coronary syndrome (heart attack), acute decompensated heart failure, severe myocarditis, and post-cardiotomy shock (shock following open heart surgery).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. Who will take care of me while I am on the ECMO?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong>The multidisciplinary staff including the cardiac or thoracic surgeons, perfusionists, critical care physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, etc. who have all been specially trained to care for ECMO patients will take care of you and your health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. How long can someone be on the ECMO for?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> It depends on the condition of the patient. Generally, a patient is on the ECMO for 1-2 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. How much does an ECMO cost?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The cost of the therapy depends upon the condition of the patient. At some hospitals, the ECMO therapy cost in India for the first four days is Rs.50, 000 - Rs.75,000 per day, which declines to Rs.35,000 - Rs.45,000 per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What is the most common complication for ECMO?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>The most common complication is bleeding. Thromboembolism and cannula complications are rare may be less than 5 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. Do you breathe while on ECMO?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>The patients are usually helped with breathing with an endotracheal tube (ET tube) placed in your mouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. Does an ECMO hurt?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Not generally. Patients connected to the ECMO are already connected to the ventilator through a breathing tube down their nose or mouth and have already received sedatives or pain medications. Even when they are connected at first, they do not feel the tubes going into their veins and arteries as they are sedated. While some medications can make you sleepy, some patients are awake so they can interact with their family and loved ones.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_name: "Gastrointestinal Cancer",
    specilization_id: "24",
    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Gastrointestinal cancer refers to the malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the accessory organs of digestion, including the oesophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. The symptoms are related to the affected organs and can also include abnormal bleeding, difficulty in swallowing and defecating, and other associated problems. Endoscopy and bioscopy are required for diagnosing the illness and identifying where it really is. Cancers of the upper digestive tract include oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, and gall bladder cancer. While colorectal and anus cancer and gastrointestinal carcinoid tumour are cancers of the lower digestive tract. Various procedures for the treatment or removal of tumours are available which include surgery, radiotherapy, and therapies using medications (immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure Of Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Esophageal Cancer-</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Surgery-</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Esophagectomy is the most common surgery for the treatment of oesophageal cancer where the doctor first detaches the oesophagus from the stomach and then removes the affected part of it and then connects the healthy part of the oesophagus to the stomach making it easier for the patient to swallow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For anal cancer, local resections can be done on the tumours which are small and have not spread but if other treatments do not seem to work out, doctors may recommend abdominoperineal resection in which the anus, rectum, part of the colon, and sometimes lymph nodes are removed and a colostomy is performed by attaching the remaining colon to an opening which is surgically made in your abdomen (stoma). Also, a small bag is attached to the stoma to collect stool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In the case of bile duct cancer, a bile duct resection can be done in which the tumour is removed by removing some or all of the bile duct it is located in. A new duct is then created by connecting it to the intestine. A partial hepatectomy may be a cure for intrahepatic bile duct cancers and more extensive extrahepatic cancers. In this, the part of the liver with the bile duct cancer is removed along with the surrounding tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Polypectomy and Local Excisions are done for colon cancer. These treatments access early-stage cancers and colon polyps through a long flexible tube that is inserted into the colon via the rectum. During the surgery, the polyps are removed from the wall of the colon. In a local excision, the cancer is removed along with a margin of the surrounding tissue. A partial or total colectomy can also be done to either remove a part of or the entire colon. In a hepatic infusion pump implantation, pumps of the size of a hockey puck are used to deliver chemotherapy directly to the metastatic colon cancers in the liver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For liver cancer, partial hepatectomy is done for metastasized colorectal cancers and metastasized neuroendocrine tumours of the small intestine and pancreas. Liver ablation is done for tumours of less than 1.5 inches in diameter. Microwave ablation is done using heat from microwaves to kill cancer cells and radiofrequency ablation is done using high-frequency electric currents. For the people who are too weak to go through a partial hepatectomy, a liver transplant is a way. In this treatment, the whole of your liver is removed and replaced with a deceased donor&rsquo;s healthy liver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Whipple procedures(pancreatoduodenectomy) are the most common surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer which includes removing the head of the pancreas, a part of the small intestine and bile duct, the gallbladder, and the associated lymph nodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For the small intestine, small bowel resection is the most common surgery. In this, the part of the intestine which is affected by the cancer cells is removed by the surgeon and then the 2 remaining sides of the intestine are connected to ensure proper functioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Partial and total gastrectomy are treatments involving partial or entire removal of the stomach based on cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Endoscopic Therapy for Oesophageal Cancer-</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A long tube called an endoscope is used to treat symptoms related to oesophageal cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Endoscopy and dilation &ndash;In this procedure, the esophagus is expanded. It may have to be repeated again if the tumour grows in size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Endoscopy with stent placement- Here, endoscopy is used to place a metal mesh stent in the esophagus to expand it and keep it open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Electrocoagulation &ndash;In this treatment, cancer cells are destroyed using the heat of electric current.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Cryotherapy- In this palliative treatment an endoscope with a probe is used which freezes the tumour and helps to reduce the size of the tumour to help the patient in swallowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Photodynamic therapy &ndash; In photodynamic therapy, light-sensitive substance called a photosensitizer is given through a vein and laser is directed at the esophageal lesions using an endoscope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Laser therapy- In this, a laser is used to burn the esophageal lesions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiation Therapy- Radiation therapy is given directly inside the body which is called internal radiation therapy. It involves inserting a radioactive wire into the area affected with cancer using an endoscope. You can expect each session to be of 10 to 30 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">Therapies Using Medications-</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy- It is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells. Medicines are often given intravenously (IV) or are swallowed (orally). Chemotherapy is cyclic and enough time is given to the patient&rsquo;s body to rest in between. One basic chemo could range from 5 minutes to 8 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Immunotherapy- It is a procedure for strengthening the immune system of the body to make it able to fight against cancer. Materials made inside the body or in the laboratory are used to improve the natural defense system of the body and are given either through a vein or orally. Every treatment takes around 30 to 90 minutes of time and continues for months with one dose every two to three weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Targeted therapy- This treatment targets proteins that control how cancer cells grow, divide and spread.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. What are the side effects of targeted therapy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Side effects of targeted therapy include diarrhoea, fatigue, liver problems, mouth sores, nail changes, loss of hair colour, and skin problems like a rash or dry skin. A hole can form through the wall of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large bowel, rectum, or gallbladder, very rarely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. What is metastatic cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Metastatic cancer is cancer that originates from one part of the body and spreads to other parts of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. What is a polyp?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>A polyp is a mushroom-like growth that forms due to the abnormal growth and division of the cells lining the colon. They become cancerous over time spreading to other parts of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What are the causes of liver cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Chronic infection, diabetes, excessive consumption of alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cirrhosis are some causes of liver cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What is the cost of gastrointestinal surgery in India?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Gastrointestinal surgery can cost 2.5 lakhs to 6 lakhs in India.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_name: "Hand Surgery",
    specilization_id: "4",
    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">It is a broad term encompassing a vast array of different types of surgery on the hand. Plastic surgeons performing hand surgery make an attempt to restore the function of the hand aswell as try to maximize the cosmetic appearance of the hand. A hand surgery may be dome for various reasons, including, but not limited to- trauma to the hand, rheumatic changes to the structures in the hand, congenital (present at birth) deformities and infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tendon repair surgery- &nbsp;A tendon repair surgery involves a surgeon making an incision in your wrist, hand or finger to locate the ends of the divided tendon and to stitch them together.Extensor tendons are much easier to reach, and hence repairing them is relatively straightforward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Nerve repair surgery- Normally, you are under general anaesthesia for a nerve repair surgery, therefore you can expect no pain during the procedure. A powerful microscope is used to examine the injured nerves. The surgeon then derides torn tissue or scar tissue from the ends. The method used to depends upon the location and the cause of the pain. If there is enough length on the ends of the nerve in order to reconnect it without stretching, the surgeon goes on to take that approach. This is the most straightforward nerve repair procedure. &nbsp;But if the doctor has to take a significant amount of tissue from the nerve, creating a gap which cannot be reconnected, a nerve from your leg or arm is harvested to place in the space in between. This procedure is called nerve grafting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Closed reduction and fixation- This surgery helps in realignment of the broken bone and also holds it in place, or immobilizes it, while it heals. Immobilization can be done with internal fixtureswith wires, rods, splintsand casts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgical drainage or debridement- In skin debridement, the skin surrounding the sore/wound is cleaned and disinfected and the wound is probed with a metal instrument fordetermining its depth and to look for foreign material or objects in the ulcer. The hyperkeratosis, infected, and nonviable tissue is excised and the ulcer is washed out.Patients undergoing percutaneous abscess drainage are usually hospitalised. This procedure uses imaging guidance to place a needle or catheter through the skin into the abscess to remove or drain the infected fluid. This treatment offers faster recovery than open surgical drainage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Carpal tunnel surgery- During a carpal tunnel release, an incision is made in the palm of your hand over the carpal tunnel ligament by the surgeon. He then cuts through the ligament to relieve pressure on the median nerve. The surgery could be done by making one incision on the palm side of the wrist, or by making several small incisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Skin graft surgery- For a split-thickness graft the surgeon would use skin from an area of your body which is usually hidden by clothing like your hip or the outside of your thigh, whereas for a full-thickness graft the surgeon will use your abdomen, groin, forearm, or area above the collarbone as the donor site.The removed skin will then be placed over the transplant site carefully and will be secured with a surgical dressing, staples, or stitches.In case of a split-thickness graft the graft will be meshed in multiple slits which allows fluid to drain from under the skin graft. &nbsp;After the procedure is completed, the surgeon will dress the donor area with a dressing which does not stick to the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Trigger finger surgery:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Open surgery- A mild sedative is given to you by the surgeon through an IV line to help you relax. The surgeon then numbs the area by injecting a local anaesthetic into your hand. An incision of about half an inch is madein your palm, in line with the affected finger or thumb. After that the surgeon cuts the tendon sheath which can impede movement if it becomes too thick. The doctor moves your finger around to ensure smooth movement. Finally, you get some stitches to close the small cut. The procedure takes from a few minutes to half an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Percutaneous release- This procedure is commonly performed formiddle and ring fingers. The doctor numbs your palm using an anaesthetic, then inserts a sturdy needle into the skin around the affected tendon. The doctor then moves the needle and your finger around to break apart the blocked area.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. What are some complications related to a trigger finger surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>The chances of complications after a trigger finger surgery are minimal but could be - nerve damage, bowstringing, when too much of the sheath is cut, persistent triggering, incomplete extension when the sheath stays tight beyond the part that was released.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. What happens after a hand surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>You can expect physical therapy soon after the procedure. Hand exercises which you can perform easily at home will be taught, with the purpose of gradually gaining strength, flexibility and range of motion again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. How long is the recovery likely to last?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>The length of the recovery period depends completely on the type of surgery performed and on the patient as well. Generally it takes two to four months to heal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What are the risks of hand surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Most surgeries carry risks related to anaesthesia and bleeding. Additional risk depends upon the type of surgery being performed and includes infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. Can you use your hand after a surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Patients should refrain from using their hands in a manner not recommended by their surgeons during their recovery period which generally is 2 to 4 months long.</p>\r\n',

Alcohol such as beer, wine or liquor and all tobacco products including cigarettes, pipes etcetera are major risk factors for head and neck cancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Surgery:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Laser technology- Laser may be used to treat early age tumours, especially the ones found in the larynx.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Excision &ndash; This is a treatment in which the tumour is removed with some healthy surrounding tissue known as margin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Lymph node or neck dissection- If it is suspected by the doctor that the cancer has spread then the lymph nodes may be removed by the doctor and it may be done with excision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Reconstructive (plastic) surgery- If cancer surgery requires removal of major tissue like jaw, skin, pharynx, or tongue, reconstructive surgery may be done to reconstruct the tissue to maintain the person&rsquo;s appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Depending upon the type, size and location of the tumour, some people may need more than one surgery. A surgery for head and neck cancer can take from 8 to 12 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Radiation therapy-External beam therapy is the most common type of radiation therapy. Proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are two types of external beam therapy. While in IMRT, advance technology is used to direct the beams of radiation directly to the tumour to decrease the side effects, in proton therapy, protons are used in place of X-rays. Proton therapy is not yet the standard mode and is being studied thoroughly. Before radiation therapy the dentist must check for any spoiled teeth because during radiation therapy many spoiled teeth get decayed. The treatments are given once or twice a day for five days a week for five to seven weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Therapies using medication-Medication is given either intravenously through a tube connected to a vein or orally using pills. The medications used for head and neck cancer are:-</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy- In chemotherapy drugs are used to destroy the cancer cells. It usually keeps them from growing or completely destroys them. Chemotherapy is given in cycles over a period of time and one drug or a combination of drugs might be used. It is given for a total of 3 to 6 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Targeted therapy- In this treatment the specific genes, proteins or the surrounding area of the tumour which contribute to it&rsquo;s growth are targeted and are destroyed. This technique inhibits the growth of the cancer and limits the damaged to the healthy cells. The doctor may ask for tests to identify the genes and proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">EGFR inhibitors &ndash;The tumour protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), when, is targeted and blocked, results in the stoppage or slow growth of certain types of head and neck cancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tumour-agnostic therapy - Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) is not specific to a certain type of cancer. It focuses on a specific genetic change in the NTRL genes. Larotrectinib is approved for metastatic head and neck cancer which cannot be removed with surgery and has worsened with other treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Immunotherapy-Also called biologic therapy, immunotherapy boosts up the body&rsquo;s ability to fight cancer by either improving or restoring the immune system function by using materials made in the body or in the laboratory. For the treatment of people with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squalors cell carcinoma, Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Many people stay on immunotherapy for up to two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For the treatment of metastatic head and neck cancer, a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy may be recommended by your doctors.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Heart Block treatment is the correction of the heart blockage that causes defected heart beat that is too slow as compared to the normal.Heart blockage occurred due to the blockage of the electrical signal that controls the heartbeat causing the heart to beat very slowly and sometimes the beat being skipped.Heart blockage is also known as Atrioventricular blockage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Types Of Heart Blockage</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">There are mainly 3 types of Heart blockage</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">First degree heart blockage</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Second degree heart blockage</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Third degree heart blockage</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before the treatment procedure begins, it is important to detect the whole heart blockage by performing specific tests which include Electrocardiograph (ECG) that determines how serious is the heart blockage, placement of loop recorder under chest skin, chest CT scan, nuclear stress test and exercise stress test are performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure Of Heart Blockage Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The treatment of choice to be followed for Heart blockage depends upon the type of the Heart blockage, extent of the heart blockage that has occurred andthe site where is blockage is present. For the first degree Heart Blockage there is no treatment required. In case of second degree Heart Blockage, if the patient is severely symptomatic , pacemaker is the treatment of choice which is an electronic device inserted in the chest region to stimulate the heart to beat</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">There are number of heart blockage treatment options available which are</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Angioplasty: The treatment helps to treat the blocked coronary arteries that causes heart blockage The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia. All the vital signs are maintained during the surgery. The surgery start with the &nbsp;dose of general anaesthesia to make the patient unconscious and thus no pain is experienced during the surgery.After giving incision at the target site, a catheter is directed to the blocked coronary artery via blood vessels. The Catheter has an attached ballon which will inflate at the site of blockage thus pressing the clot formed and making space for the blood to flow. The location of the blockage is identified with the help of fluoroscopy that is c-Rays and the contrast dye used make it possible to view the blockage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Atherectomy: This procedure is used to remove the abnormal&nbsp; fat with an overlying fibrous cap &nbsp;from the blood vessel with the help of sharp blade containing catheter. The procedure is usually performed under local anaesthesia. The procedure begins with insertion of catheter that contains sharp cutting tip to remove the plaque from the vessel. After the removal of the plaque stunt is inserted anddye is injected to check the blood flow to the organ. After the procedure is completed catheter is removed and the ares is covered with sterile dressing. The procedure is around 3-4 hours long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Other Heart Blockage treatments include Bypass Surgery, Cardiomyoplasty, Minimally invasive Heart surgery and stent placement. The treatment for heart blockage should start as soon as possible to prevent the serious outcomes and to save the life of the patient.

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Heart Transplant is a major open heart surgery that is performed to replace the diseased or defected heart of the patient with a new heart from the donor that has been declared brain dead. This is the last and most reliable treatment procedure of heart when all other options have failed to work. The major&nbsp; reason for the Heart Transplant surgery is the failure of the heart that has reached to the last stage. This could be due the reason that the heart muscles have become so weak that they are not able to pump blood. Heart transplant is indicated in case of&nbsp;&nbsp; Myocardial Infarction, Congenital defect in the heart,viral infection of the heart and in case of chronic &nbsp;lung disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify">PROCEDURE FOR THE HEART TRANSPLANT</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure of the Heart Transplant surgery consist of the following steps</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Checking if the of the candidate can undergo &nbsp;heart transplant on the basis of the blood tests and , diagnostic tests performed. Blood test help in matching the donor easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">.After all the test result are found to be in favour of the heart transplant, the search of the suitable donor organ begins for the patient. This search period for the donors organ can be long as the number of the patients who need heart transplant are way more than the number of available donors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Once a suitable donors organ is found, based upon the size of the body and the blood group matching, candidate matching the donors organ is finalised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure starts with giving general anaesthesia to the patient. After that catheters are placed at the suitable locations to monitor the patients heart status, and to take blood samples during the surgery. To give &nbsp;medicine an intravenous fluid throughout the surgery , intravenous catheter is given. It is made sure to drain the fluid from the stomach and urine from the bladder via flexible tube inserted in the stomach and mouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Incision is given in the centre of the chest to reach the heart via the rib cage. The diseased heart of the patient is removed by cutting off the blood vessels connecting to the heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;After removing the diseased heart of the patient within 4 hours, after the donors heart is removed from the donor, is placed in the patient and it is now connected to the blood vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The transplanted heart starts beating when the surgeon gives shock to heart. The is observed for a while immediately after the surgery to check the working of the new heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Incisions are closed thereafter and dressing is given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">After the transplant is completed is patient is kept in the intensive care unit to check all the vitals throughout the period and ECG is observed regularly.Until the patient is not stable enough breathing tubes are not removed. Once the patient starts breathing and responding on their own,breathing tubes are removed. Diagnostic tests and blood tests are repeated after the surgery to check the proper functioning of the new heart.Pain killers are given to control the pain that the patient experience while coughing and breathing after the heart transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The procedure takes around 4 -5 hours. The patient has to stay in the hospital under observation for attest 14 days and the duration may be more depending upon the condition of the parent after the surgery. Medications after the heart transplant surgery is given to the patient are Immunosuppressive drugs after the heart transplant. These drugs help the immune system not to attack the new heart as it will recognise the new heart as a foreign body and as a result may try to harm it.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">For people with severe hip damage caused by osteoarthritis and due to symptoms like hip pain which limits daily activities like walking or bending, stiffness in the hip, inadequate pain relief from anti-inflammatory drugs, and when other treatments like physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise do not help, hip replacement surgery is opted by surgeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">For evaluation, your orthopedic surgeon may ask for a complication physical examination. Tests like blood and urine tests, an electrocardiogram, and chest x-rays might be needed for planning the treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Upon your arrival, you will be given anesthesia (the type depending upon your body)to block sensation from the waist down. An incision is made, generally at the side or back of the hip in order to expose the bones at the hip joint. The joint is then dislocated by the surgeon and the head of the femur is removed from its socket (acetabulum). In a total hip arthroplasty (total hip replacement), the damaged bone and cartilage are replaced with prosthetic components. The Thearthritic femoral head is cut off with a bone saw. The acetabulum is prepared for the acetabular cup prosthesis using a special tool called a hemispheric reamer to grind down and shape the socket. Then, the acetabular cup which is made up of porous titanium metal to allow the bone to grow into it over time, is inserted into the prepared socket. The cup can also be secured with special bone cement. The patient&rsquo;s physiology and the surgeon&rsquo;s preferences determine the type of cup and the way of attaching the cup. A rounded acetabular insert/liner (which may be plastic or ceramic and would ensure effortless movement in the joint) is inserted inside the acetabular cup. Then the surgeon prepares the femur bone in order to insert the prosthetic femoral stem( a narrow, tapered metal shaft that fits inches down the femur) into it. The top of the stem is created as such to hold a prosthetic ball to replace the femoral head. The ball is then attached to the top of the femoral head, the size of which is already matched to the acetabulum cup and insert. A temporary ball will be inserted by the surgeon to ensure ease of movement and no dislocation. The trial component will then be removed and the final component will be put into place. A check for ease of movement, potential ease of dislocation, and restoration of the natural anatomy of the hip including the leg length, will be made. Through X-rays, proper sizing and position involved of the components will be ensured and any cuts or incisions, previously made, will be fixed altogether completing the procedure. This procedure takes around 1-2 hours of time.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Hip resurfacing is a form of hip replacement surgery used to ease pain and stiffness in the hip caused by osteoarthritis and other conditions. It is an alternative to the traditional total hip replacement (THR) surgery. If the non-surgical treatment options available are already exhausted and if you have more advanced osteoarthritis, hip resurfacing surgery might be advised by your doctors. The candidates below the age of 60 are considered as the best patients for this type of surgery. Older patients, however, have an increased risk of complications like femoral neck fracture. The implants made by a hip resurfacing surgery allow better fluid movement by taking place of the damaged tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">With spinal anaesthesia, you will be sedated. An incision will be made in the thigh in order to access the hip joint. The damaged bones and cartilage will trim from the thighbone head ball. A smooth metal cap will then be attached with surgical cement to the ball. Then a metal shell is pushed into the hip socket with a roughened back which attaches itself to the pelvic bone. The femoral head is moved into the socket. Finally, the incision is stitched. The whole procedure takes around two hours. You will be required to spend a day or two in the hospital and you will be allowed to go home after the doctor approves your condition.</p>\r\n',

How much time does it take to recover from a hip resurfacing surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>You can expect pain or discomfort for several weeks after the surgery. A vast majority of patients recover within months and return to their daily routine and activities within months after the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What will happen when the hip resurfacing wears out?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>When this happens, it can be converted to a traditional total hip replacement with a stem in the thigh bone, utilising a big metal ball to match your socket.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What are the major benefits of hip resurfacing?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Preservation of the bone is one major factor of hip resurfacing over hip replacement. It also has a ball of greater diameter which provides greater theoretical range of motion. It is also more stable and the dislocation rate is lower as compared to the traditional hip replacement surgery. You can also return to more impact activity as the hip resurfacing loads the bone of the femur the way it is in your own hip.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6.

Why should I have a hip resurfacing vs. a traditional total hip replacement?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Both of these are designed to improve the functioning of your body and to decrease the pain. For patients with a higher demand of impact activities, hip resurfacing would be a better option. For people who want to preserve the bone, generally the young group, resurfacing would be an excellent choice but for a person for whom the traditional total hip replacement surgery could last the rest of his/her life, total hip replacement could be the option.</p>\r\n',

The cancers which have spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity are difficult to treat through a traditional chemotherapy. HIPEC surgery can be effective in such cases. It is a two-step procedure involving a cytoreductive surgery and a hipec surgery. The most common cancers treated through HIPEC surgery are appendix cancer, colon and rectal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, mesothelioma, adrenal cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic and peritoneal cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">All visible tumours are first removed from the abdomen by the surgeons through a technique called tumour debunking or cytoreductive surgery. The extent of this surgery is decided by the amount of tumour in the patient&rsquo;s abdomen. Surgeons delicately remove any visible tumours in the abdomen which could even include involved organs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">During the second phase of the surgery (HIPEC), a heated sterile solution containing a chemotherapeutic agent is constantly circulated through the peritoneal cavity. It is heated chemo, hence it penetrates the tissue. Surgeons rock the patient back and forth to make certain that the remaining cancer cells come in contact with the solution. It is done for 2 hours continuously. The combination of chemotherapy and heat which is delivered directly to the abdomen proves to be more effective than the traditional chemotherapy treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">With the help of this procedure, the chemo can be delivered directly where the tumour cells are and do not therefore affect the body with any side effects. The operation can be time consuming as the tumour removal process, based on how many tumours are to be removed, takes anywhere from one hour to eight hours and the chemotherapy application takes two hours more.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. What kinds of cancer can this procedure treat?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> This procedure can cover peritoneal surface malignancies, or PSM which encompasses colon cancer, appendix cancer, mesothelioma cancer, gastric cancer, peritoneal cancer, rectal cancer, liver cancer and adrenal cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. How long does it take to recover after HIPEC treatment?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Four to twelve weeks could be the average recovery period for the patients depending upon the extent of your surgery. Patients need to stay in the hospital for 7-10 days so that the digestive system can recover from the intense dose of chemotherapy they earlier received.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. What is the success rate of HIPEC surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Around 25-30 percent of patients&rsquo; cancers are cured with the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What are the side effects of HIPEC?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Some of the side effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and hair loss, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, bloating, weight loss and difficulty in sleeping. Also, as it is with all major surgeries, there are standard risks of infection, effects of anaesthesia and bleeding. Most side effects are minor but some could require further hospital management.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. What is the cost of HIPEC surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The cost of an HIPEC surgery can be around 4-6 lakhs in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. What type of chemo is used in a HIPEC surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> During HIPEC, the surgeon removes tumours from the abdominal area. After removing the tumours, cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug, is heated to 103 degrees Fahrenheit and pumped through the abdominal area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. What are the benefits of HIPEC?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> It allows for higher concentration than the traditional chemotherapy which is done intravenously and is not targeted, as it is directly targeted at the site of the tumour. Also, in HIPEC, the chemotherapy is able to penetrate the tissue and kill microscopic tumour as well.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Interventional Cardiology is a branch of cardiology that treats the diseased heart with the help of a catheter based treatment technique. This technique has a benefit of causing minimal scar and pain and avoiding long term recovery period. Angioplasty is the process of opening of the blocked arteries of the heart. It is one of the procedure of interventional cardiology. In angioplasty, a catheter with is balloon is inserted at the site of the clogged artery and then inflated there. This causes widening of the artery thus making way for the unobtrusive blood flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure Of Interventional Cardiology </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Balloon Angioplasty </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This procedure of interventional cardiology starts with giving anaesthesia to the patient followed by giving incision in the chest region and reaching the heart and then insertion of catheter with a balloon at its tip into the region of the blocked artery in the heart. The balloon attached to the catheter is then inflated at the region of the blocked artery which compresses the observation in the artery or the plaque and widening the artery diameter which increases the flow of the blood to the heart. This technique is known as per cutaneous coronary intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rot Ablation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In this procedure, Catheter having acorn shaped with diamond quoted tip is used. The tip is made to spin at a high speed at the site of the blocked artery thus grinding away the collected plaque at the artery. The process is repeated until all the plaque that cause blockage is removed. This procedure is known as per cutaneous Trasnsluminal Rotational Atherectomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Balloon angioplasty with Stenting</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This technique involves placing a stent with the help of catheter at the site of the blockage of the artery. The Catheter will be removed thereafter after the placement of the stent at the blockage site. The artery around the stunt will be free of obstruction with time. This technique is used in case of more than one coronary artery blockage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Drug Eluting Stents (DES)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">This procedure makes use of drug along with the stent placement. The drug is released at the site of stent placement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cutting Balloon </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Cutting balloon technique makes use of Cather that has small blades along with balloon tip. These blades will cut away the plaque at the site of obstruction and thus make way for the blood flow through the artery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">After the procedure is complete the patient is advised to take rest and is kept under observation for s day or two in the hospital after the surgery. The patient can return back to normal routine within a week or maximum 10 days. There are many complications that may arise after the surgery that includes bleeding at the site where catheter was inserted, discomfort at the site of catheter insertion, fever and redness, drainage from the site of incision, chest lain and breathless. Drugs used during the interventional cardiology include anti platelet drugs such as aspirin thienopyridine and glycoproteins and anti thrombotic drugs.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">Intrauterine Insemination is a minimally invasive and cost effective treatment procedure for infertility in which, sperms are placed directly into the uterus via a catheter during the ovulation cycle of the female. Intrauterine Insemination treatment is done in the cases where the sperm count is low, in endometriosis, ejaculation dysfunction and single females who want to conceive without sexual intercourse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Intrauterine Insemination Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Before the actual procedure start various diagnostic tests such as blood tests and ultrasound are carried out. This is done to determine the period of ovulation. The procedure starts with the collecting the semen from the male partner. Then the sperms are collected from the semen sample. This is followed by washing of the sperm samples. Washing of the sperms is done because there is a non sperm element that is present in the semen. This non sperm element has the ability to cause infection the female and thus effect the fertilisation process. After washing of the sperms, the aim of the treatment is to collect the small, high quality and highly concentrated sperms from the samples. The small, normal looking and the highly active sperm is chosen. The purpose of the selecting a highly active and good quality sperm is to increase the success rate of the treatment procedure as it boosts the chances of conceiving. After this the female partner is injected with Human Gonadotropin Hormone. The hormone injection is given to release the egg. After the eggs are released, the doctor will now inject the sperm sample collected into the lining of the uterus via a catheter that is long thin tube, by gently opening the vagina and viewing the cervix. The sole purpose of the procedure is to decrease the time and the amount of distance that the sperm has to travel to reach the egg and fertilise it. After two weeks of the Intrauterine Insemination, pregnancy tests are performed to check the success of the treatment procedure. If the pregnancy test comes negative, patient is advised to go for the second cycle of Intrauterine Insemination without losing hope. Maximum of 3-6 cycles of the Intrauterine Insemination are performed and if results are negative, then the patient is advised to go for In vitro Fertilisation. This is a non invasive procedure and first and the best treatment option for infertility problem but the results may vary according the patient. It may helps in fertilisation in some cases and in other cases where this treatment does not respond well, other options such as In vitro fertilisation may be used. The cost of the treatment is quite less compared to other treatment options. It is usually between 4000-5000 rupee for the single cycle of Intrauterine Insemination. This procedure is smooth and rarely causes any discomfort. Mild vaginal bleeding may occur during the treatment that is normal. Some patients may experience mild cramps after the treatment that goes away easily. The length of the treatment procedure is around 20-30 minutes long and is carried out in the doctor&rsquo;s clinic.</p>\r\n',

This is the best and last treatment option for the women who have blockage in the fallopian tubes and cannot conceive naturally, older women who are not able to conceive due to infertility problems and men who have a very low count of sperms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><strong>Procedure for In-Vitro-Fertilization</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt">The in-vitro-fertilization procedure mainly consists of five important steps that need to be followed.</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:11pt">Stimulation Of Ovaries</span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt">This is the first step of the in-vitro-fertilization in which the woman is given medicines to increase the count of the eggs produced. The medicine aids the ovaries to produce more eggs compared to normal count that is only egg per month. Increase in egg production increases the chances of fertilization to take place. The ovaries are examined on a regular basis via ultrasounds. Hormones levels are monitored during this step of the procedure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:11pt">Removal Of The Matured Egg From The Ovaries</span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt">Before the egg removal, it is made sure that the eggs are ripened or mature enough to be taken out. Injections containing medicine to mature the eggs are given. The eggs must be collected at a proper stage of development, neither too early nor too late. If this doesn&rsquo;t happen, it will hinder the development of the eggs.&nbsp; With the help of ultrasound, the doctor will collect the eggs from the ovaries by inserting a hollow tube into the ovaries via vagina. The hollow needle attached to the suction tip will suck the eggs along with the fluid from the ovaries. It is performed under anaesthesia.

To increase the chances of pregnancy, sometimes 2-3 embryos are transferred at a time. The duration of the procedure is around several hours followed by immediate bed rest of around 4-6 hours before leaving the clinic. To check the success of the procedure, that is whether the pregnancy is there, pregnancy tests are being performed by the doctor after 14 days of the embryo transfer. Whether the treatment will be a success or not depends upon the factors such as the technique with which the procedure has been performed, types of the eggs used in the treatment, age of the patient, etc.</span></h3>\r\n',

Depending upon the need of the procedure, that is, whether it is carried out to diagnose a particular disease or for the treatment of the disease, the number of incisions to be given is decided accordingly. For the diagnosis purpose, only one incision is given and for the treatment, multiple incisions are given. Through the incision a tube is passed into the target site. Now carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the tube to reach the target site and inflate it for better vision during the surgery. Through the incision laparoscopy which is an instrument that has a telescopic lens system connected to give the image of the affected site on the screen, instruments are passed. The correct position of the instrument into the affected site is reached with the help of the laparoscope. Once the instrument reaches the position, the procedure is carried out over there out of the target site. After the surgery, closure of the incisions with stitches is done. If the keyhole surgery is performed for the diagnosis of a disease, it will take around 30-60 minutes and if it is carried out for the treatment of a particular disease, the procedure will be longer than an hour.</span></p>\r\n',

How much does it cost for the keyhole surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The average cost of the treatment is around 35000 to 60000 rupees in India. The cost of the treatment may vary according to the hospital. It is usually expensive compared to open surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. What is the ideal age for the keyhole surgery to be performed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> There is no specific age for the keyhole surgery to be performed. The ideal candidate for the surgery is the one who does not have any heart problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. Can keyhole surgery be fatal?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> Keyhole surgery is not life threatening. Rarely one in a hundred cases may be fatal too because of some predisposing conditions the patient may be suffering from. The risk of death with keyhole surgery is very low.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. What precautions should be followed after the keyhole surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.</strong> The patient is advised to take complete rest after the surgery and should not lift anything that is heavier than 15 pounds. The patient should take a complete antibiotic course prescribed to avoid the chances of infection.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_brief:
      '<p style="text-align:justify">A kidney transplant is a procedure done to replace the dysfunctional kidneys with healthy kidneys from either a living or a deceased donor. The main function that the kidneys play in our body isfiltering and removing waste, minerals and fluid no longer needed in the body through urine. If the kidneys loose their ability of filtering the waste and fluids, large amounts of these toxic substances accumulate in your body and increase your blood pressure and result in kidney failure which is the end-stage kidney disease. When the kidneys have lost about 90% of their ability to function normally, end-stage renal disease occurs. The common causes of end-stage kidney disease include Diabetes, Chronic, uncontrolled high blood pressure, Chronic glomerulonephritis &mdash; an inflammation and eventual scarring of the tiny filters within your kidneys (glomeruli) and Polycystic kidney disease. A kidney transplant or dialysis is mandatory for the people diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease. A kidney transplant is always the main option as compared with a lifetime on dialysis. As compared to dialysis, a kidney transplant can give the patient: A better quality of life, lower risk of death, fewer dietary restrictions and a lower cost of treatment. But for certain people with kidney failure, a transplant may be more risky than dialysis. These people include &ndash; people of advanced age, people with severe heart disease, patients with active or recently treated cancer, people on alcohol and drugs,&nbsp; &nbsp;people with dementia or other mental illnesses and patients with any other factor that could affect the ability to safely undergo the procedure and take the medications needed after a transplant to prevent organ rejection. Only one donated kidney is needed to replace two kidneys which makes kidney transplant a good option. A donor could be a living or deceased donor. Tests used to determine whether a donated kidney is fit for you or not include blood typing, tissue typing and crossmatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A kidney transplant is a major treatment hence the patients are under general anaesthesia during the whole procedure. The whole procedure takes around two to three hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Open nephrectomy is performed traditionally which involves making one 15-20 centimetre long incision at the side of the abdomen to remove the kidney. This technique is still prevalent and used by many surgeons.A kidney transplants can also be done using &ldquo;keyhole&rdquo; or laparoscopic surgical techniques. This surgery is becoming more common as time and technology is advancing. The laparoscopic technique involves a number of small incisions which are 1-3 centimetres long, through which laparoscopic instruments are inserted in order to remove the kidney. Then, a larger incision is made to take out the kidney. A Keyhole surgery may take longer to perform than the traditional open nephrectomy, but it is helpful as the recovery time in this technique is quicker as the incisions are smaller.After the kidney of the donor is removed, he/she is taken to the recovery room. From the operation, he or she would be having several tubesinserted during the operation, which may include a tube inserted into the bladder (catheter) and a drainage tube from the wound, all of which are removed a few days after the surgery. To carry a kidney transplant, number of methods is used the most common of which is a Gibson Incision which is a three stage procedure. During the first step, an incision is made in the lower abdomen, through which the donated kidney is placed in your body.The kidneys of the patient will usually be left as they are and where they are, until they cause a problem, for example an infection.Secondly, blood vessels from your lower abdomen will be attached to that of the donated kidney which provide the donated kidney with the blood supply which is needed for them to function properly. At last, the ureter of the donated kidney is connected to the bladder of the patient.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">Liposuction is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of excessive fat of the body by suction with the help of specialized surgical equipments.The sites of fat removal are usually the abdomen, hips, thighs, neck, arms and buttocks. Liposuction also helps to contour the site involved in the fat removal that means, it gives a proper shape to these areas. Others name for this treatment are Lipoplasty and body contouring. This is not an overall solution to complete weight loss. Liposuction is mainly done for the patients who have excessive fat at specific body locations and otherwise have a normal body weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">These are the different types of technologies that are applied in the liposuction surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Tumescent liposuction</strong>: It is the common type among all. It involves injecting a sterile solution that helps in the fat removal followed by local anesthesia namely lidocaine that help to relieve pain and at last drug named epinephrine is added to constrict the blood vessels in the area where the surgery is to be performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ultrasound-assisted liposuction</strong>: In this type of liposuction insertion of metal rod is done in the skin that will emit ultrasonic energy and helps to burst the fat cell walls and ultimately the fat molecules. Laser assisted liposuction: It involves removing the fat by breaking it with the help of a high intensity laser light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Power assisted liposuction</strong>: This technique involves fat removal with rapid back and forth motion of the cannula. This technique is not much painful and is more precise for the fat removal. This is used in case of patient with a history of prior liposuction treatment</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The surgery involves insertion of the hollow tube known as cannula through the small incision that is made into the skin. The inserted cannula removes the excessive fat that is located as pockets of fats, from the various body parts. .The procedure is usually not highly invasive. During the procedure regional or local anesthesia is injected to the part from the fat has to be removed. General anesthesia may also be required in some cases to make the patient relaxed and calm. Heart rate, blood oxygen level and blood pressure of the patient are monitored throughout the treatment procedure. The surgery starts with marking the areas where the procedure has to be performed. Pictures are taken to show the patient before and after treatment differences and the desired results achieved. Sedatives and antibiotics are prescribed by the surgeon for infection and pain control. Patient is advised not to wear tight fitting garments as the incision are left open by the doctor and it may cause pain to the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Complications:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Anesthesia related risk may arise followed by infection, swelling, accumulation of fluid at the site of the surgery, poor healing of the wound. Further, there may be bleeding under the skin and pigmentation of the treated areas of the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Duration:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The surgery is carried for several hours and the time involved varies with the site of the surgery. Usually the patient under general anesthesia will wake up after sometime. The patient is monitored by the team of doctors for few hours after the surgery so that the patient does not get dehydrated and go to the state of shock. Therefore it is usually advisable to stay overnight to avoid any sudden complication. The patient is advised to wait for few days before resuming their normal lifestyle and work.</p>\r\n',

      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. How much does it cost a person to get the liposuction surgery done?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans</strong>. The cost of the treatment depends upon the number of sites involved in the surgery. If only single site is involved then the cost will be less compared to the multiple sites involved for fat removal. Average cost range between Rs.50, 000 to Rs 1, 00,000 and will increase further depending on the number of areas included in the treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. For how long does the patient have to stay in the hospital after the treatment?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>The procedure is completed within hours. But usually the patient is recommended to stay for at least one night at the hospital under the observation of the doctors. It usually takes around 5-7 days for the patient to completely cure and return to normal work life and routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3.&nbsp; Is the liposuction treatment painful?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>he treatment is painless while it is performed as the patient is under anesthesia. But yes, the patient may experience some after the effect of anesthesia wears off. For this purpose the doctor prescribe antibiotics and painkillers to the patient for time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q..4.&nbsp; For how long the results of the liposuction stay after the surgery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>Liposuction treatment results are permanent and the fat does not return back. This is followed by weight maintained by the patient after the surgery because fat distribution changes as the person gains weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5.&nbsp; Is liposuction treatment suitable for everyone?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>Persons with heart diseases, diabetes and weak immunity should avoid this treatment. Anyone above 18 years of age and with good health is all set to go for the treatment.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">A rarer type of cancer, liver cancer affects a minimal size of the population. It emerges from the cells in the liver. Sometimes, the normal instruction cycles of our body can be altered due to the mutation of the DNA present in our body or a change in its genetic code. As a result, there is an abnormal growth in the cells leading to a tumour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">People with conditions like hepatitis B or C, alcohol users and people with cirrhosis are at an increased risk of getting affected with liver cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The types of liver cancer include primary and secondary liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of primary liver cancer which begins in cells known as hepatocytes. Secondary liver cancer is cancer that starts from a different location and moves to the liver. It is also called metastatic liver cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Early-stage liver cancer can be treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, ablation or catheter-directed therapy. However, people with severe liver tumour must go for a transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Liver cancer may be treated with surgery, locoregional therapy, different kinds of drug therapies or even a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Surgical Treatments</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Partial Hepatectomy - Partial Hepatectomy or liver resection is performed under general anaesthesia using minimally invasive techniques. Incisions are made on your right abdomen and needle-like ports are inserted through these cuts to guide the surgical tools without harming the surrounding area. A portion of the liver is cauterized to seal the blood vessels and prevent internal bleeding. Then, using the laparoscope, layers of the liver are cut one by one until the cancerous portion is removed. This treatment is only available for people with a liver in good condition and a single tumour that has not yet grown into the blood vessels. The treatment can take anywhere between two to four hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Total Hepatectomy and liver transplant&ndash;In total Hepatectomy, the whole liver is replaced with a healthy liver of a donor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Most treatments take 2-4 hours of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Other Treatments</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Ablation therapy- Cryoablation, microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation and ethanol ablation are used to treat tumours without removing them. This is done by destroying them directly. The entire procedure takes around 1 to 3 hours of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Chemotherapy - This is a therapy in which drugs are used to destroy cancer cells. It is systemic ( the pills and injections travel inside the whole body). As the chemo is given in cycles it can take two to three weeks of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Targeted therapy &ndash;Here, drugs are used to zero in on the cancer tissues or cells. It is different from chemotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Immunotherapy &ndash;In this therapy, drugs are given to direct the immune system to kill the cancer cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Loco-regional therapy&ndash; In this, beads is injected into the blood vessels which feed the tumor (Radio mobilization). The beads deliver radiation therapy directly into the tumor when they become trapped in the small blood vessels of the tumor. A different version of this type of therapy is called chemoembolization of the hepatic artery. The chemotherapy drug is mixed with the beads in order to block the artery.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">A liver transplant or hepatic transplant is done to replace a failed liver with a part of or all of the liver of either a deceased or a living donor. When the cells of the liver are destroyed, much of its function is lost. It is able to flourish again except for the cases in which the cells are majorly destroyed. Patients with end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure can avail this treatment keeping in mind the major life modifications after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Tests including an electrocardiogram, blood tests and a chest X-ray will be taken beforehand. The operation is performed through a large incision in the upper abdomen. During the operation, all ligamentous attachments like the bile duct, hepatic vein, hepatic artery and the portal vein are separated from the diseased liver. The blood in the donor&rsquo;s liver is replaced by an ice-cold organ storing solution like HTK or UW (Viaspan) up to the time of the implantation of the allograft liver while the blood entering the patient&rsquo;s liver is blocked or sent back through another tube into his body. The healthy liver is then attached by the surgeon to the bile duct and other attachments and blood flow is resumed. Several tubes are placed in the in the body to aid the body in certain functions during the procedure and for a few days after the operation as well. Liver transplantation procedures take approximately 4 to 14 hours and the average hospital stay is two to three weeks. Depending on the complications and other possibilities, one needs to be prepared for lesser or more time. During the recovery period, you will have regular blood testing and will be given certain immunosuppressive drugs like corticosteroids plus a calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin to prevent rejection, initially through the vein and later by mouth.Your diet will first begin with clear liquids, slowly progressing towards solid foods as the liver starts to function. Before the discharge, the patient learns the signs of infection and rejection and when to call a doctor. Following the doctor recommended post-transplantation plan, the patient can expect a good outcome.</p>\r\n',

      '<p style="text-align:justify">It is a surgical procedure to replace either of or both the dysfunctional lungs with healthy lungs of a cadaver donor.Lungs that are unhealthy can pose an abundance of problems by not providing the amount of oxygen your body needs. The diseases which hinder the ability of the lungs to function include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high blood pressure in the lungs, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lungs)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">While some lung diseases require the patient to receive one lung, others like cystic fibrosis require the patient to receive two healthy lungs. Lung transplants carry certain risks but can help to improve the quality of life. It is a procedure which is reserved for people on whom other procedures have been implemented but have failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Procedure for Treatment </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Some steps, common to all types of treatments are followed before the main procedure. These include the testing of the donor&rsquo;s lung(s), on the approval of which the recipient is connected to an IV line and various monitoring equipment including pulse oximetry. General anaesthesia is given to the patient and a machine which would breathe for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In single-lung transplantation, the lung with a worsened pulmonary function is chosen to be replaced and if both of the lungs function equally, the right lung is preferred to the left to avoid manoeuvring around the heart. Either an incision from under the shoulder blade around the chest ending near the sternum, or an incision under the breastbone is made. The lung is collapsed, the blood vessels of the lung are tied off and&nbsp; and it is removed at the bronchial tube. After that, the donor&rsquo;s lung is reattached to the blood vessels and the lung is reinflated. A bronchoscopy is then performed to ensure the clearance of the remaining blood and mucus in the lung. The surgeons then close the incision after their satisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">In the case of sequential double lung transplant, an incision is made from the patient&#39;s under armpit, around to the sternum, and then back towards the other armpit; which is termed as a clamshell incision. The weakest functioning lung is collapsed, the blood vessels tied off and cut at the corresponding bronchi. The healthy lung is then placed and the blood vessels are reattached. Bronchoscopy is performed to ensure that the lung is satisfactory. After the surgeons are assured of the first lung, the second lung is replaced with the same procedure. During 10 to 20 percent of double-lung transplants, the patient&rsquo;s body is attached to a heart-lung machine which pumps blood and provides for the oxygen of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Usually, it takes around one hour for the pre-operative preparation and four to eight hours for a single-lung transplant. Whereas double-lung transplantation takes around six to twelve hours to complete.A history of prior chest operations could complicate the procedure and lead to requirement of additional time.</p>\r\n',

    treatment_faqs:
      '<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.1. What are the risks associated with lung transplant?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>These include bleeding, infection, failure or rejection of the lungs, blockage of the airways, pulmonary oedema and blockage of blood vessels to the new lung/s.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.2. What is the cost of a lung transplant?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>A lung transplant can cost around 25-35 lakhs in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.3. What is the average lifespan after a lung transplant?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>5 out of 10 people live for at least 5 years. Many people also live for more than 10 upto 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.4. How long will I be hospitalised after the transplant?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>Although a patient generally starts recovering within 10 days, it is more typical for patients to be hospitalised for more than 2 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.5. Can you have a lung transplant more than once?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;</strong>Yes, it is possible but not common. Retransplantation occurs for about 4 percent of lung transplant procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.6. How long does it take to recover from a lung transplant?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>Recovery time depends on the patient. The transplanted lung should start working in a few hours after the surgery and after 3-6 months the risk of rejection will become minimal. Also, your immunosuppressants will be reduced and your energy should be more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Q.7. Who all are eligible for a lung transplant?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Ans. </strong>People who do not respond to any other medications after a lung failure must go for a lung transplant. The causes of lung disease include - idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary hypertension.</p>\r\n',
